        "**Gymnasium** is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. It provides various environments that simulate different tasks and challenges, which agents (algorithms) can interact with to learn and improve their performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How Gymnasium Can Be Useful for Computational Biologists**\n",
        "\n",
        "Gymnasium can be a valuable tool for computational biologists in several ways. Here are some potential applications:\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **1. Modeling Biological Systems**\n",
        "Gymnasium provides a platform for simulating and modeling complex biological systems. Computational biologists can use Gymnasium environments to create and test models of cellular processes, metabolic pathways, and genetic networks. This helps in understanding the dynamics of these systems and predicting their behavior under different conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **2. Reinforcement Learning for Drug Discovery**\n",
        "Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can be applied to drug discovery and development. By using Gymnasium environments, computational biologists can train RL agents to explore chemical spaces, optimize molecular structures, and predict the efficacy of potential drug candidates. This accelerates the drug discovery process and reduces the need for costly and time-consuming experiments.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **3. Optimization of Experimental Protocols**\n",
        "Gymnasium can be used to optimize experimental protocols in computational biology. For example, RL agents can be trained to design efficient experimental setups, select optimal parameters, and minimize experimental errors. This leads to more accurate and reproducible results in biological research.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **4. Simulating Evolutionary Processes**\n",
        "Gymnasium environments can simulate evolutionary processes, allowing computational biologists to study the evolution of populations, genetic diversity, and adaptation mechanisms. By modeling these processes, researchers can gain insights into the principles of evolution and apply them to areas such as conservation biology and synthetic biology.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **5. Analyzing Biological Data**\n",
        "Gymnasium can be integrated with data analysis tools to analyze large-scale biological data. Computational biologists can use Gymnasium environments to preprocess, visualize, and interpret data from genomics, proteomics, and other omics studies. This helps in identifying patterns, correlations, and potential biomarkers.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **6. Training and Education**\n",
        "Gymnasium can be used as an educational tool to teach computational biology concepts. Students and researchers can interact with Gymnasium environments to learn about biological systems, experiment with different algorithms, and gain hands-on experience in computational modeling and simulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example Use Case: Protein Folding**\n",
        "One specific application is the study of protein folding. Computational biologists can use Gymnasium to create environments that simulate the folding process of proteins. RL agents can be trained to predict the final folded structure of a protein based on its amino acid sequence. This has significant implications for understanding diseases related to protein misfolding and designing therapeutic interventions.\n",
        "\n",
        "By leveraging Gymnasium, computational biologists can enhance their research capabilities, accelerate discoveries, and gain deeper insights into the complexities of biological systems."

        "\n",
        "Q-Learning is a foundational technology upon which deep reinforcement learning is based. Before we explore deep reinforcement learning, it is essential to understand Q-Learning. Several components make up any Q-Learning system.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Agent** - The agent is an entity that exists in an environment that takes actions to affect the state of the environment, to receive rewards.\n",
        "2. **Environment** - The environment is the universe that the agent exists in. The environment is always in a specific state that is changed by the agent's actions.\n",
        "3. **Actions** - Steps that the agent can perform to alter the environment\n",
        "4. **Step** - A step occurs when the agent performs an action and potentially changes the environment state.\n",
        "5. **Episode** - A chain of steps that ultimately culminates in the environment entering a terminal state.\n",
        "6. **Epoch** - A training iteration of the agent that contains some number of episodes.\n",
        "7. **Terminal State** -  A state in which further actions do not make sense. A terminal state occurs when the agent has one, lost, or the environment exceeds the maximum number of steps in many environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-Learning works by building a table that suggests an action for every possible state. This approach runs into several problems. First, the environment is usually composed of several continuous numbers, resulting in an infinite number of states. Q-Learning handles continuous states by binning these numeric values into ranges.\n",
        "\n",
        "Out of the box, Q-Learning does not deal with continuous inputs, such as a car's accelerator that can range from released to fully engaged. Additionally, Q-Learning primarily deals with discrete actions, such as pressing a joystick up or down. Researchers have developed clever tricks to allow Q-Learning to accommodate continuous actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Deep neural networks can help solve the problems of continuous environments and action spaces. In the next section, we will learn more about deep reinforcement learning. For now, we will apply regular Q-Learning to the Mountain Car problem from OpenAI Gym.\n",

Because gravity is stronger than the car's engine, it cannot merely accelerate up the steep slope even with full throttle. The vehicle is situated in a valley and must learn to utilize potential energy by driving up the opposite hill before the car can make it to the goal at the top of the rightmost hill.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, it might be helpful to visualize the mountain car environment. The following code shows this environment. This code makes use of TF-Agents to perform this render. Usually, we use TF-Agents for the type of deep reinforcement learning that we will see in the next module. However, TF-Agents is just used to render the mountain care environment for now."

Released on August 12, 1981, it was created by a team of engineers and designers at International Business Machines (IBM), directed by William C. Lowe and Philip Don Estridge in Boca Raton, Florida.\n",

        "Powered by an x86-architecture Intel 8088 processor, the machine was based on open architecture and third-party peripherals. Over time, expansion cards and software technology increased to support it. The PC had a substantial influence on the personal computer market; the specifications of the IBM PC became one of the most popular computer design standards in the world. The only significant competition it faced from a non-compatible platform throughout the 1980s was from Apple's Macintosh product line, as well as consumer-grade platforms created by companies like Commodore and Atari. Most present-day personal computers share architectural features in common with the original IBM PC, including the Intel-based Mac computers manufactured from 2006 to 2022.\n",

        "Prior to the 1980s, IBM had largely been known as a provider of business computer systems. As the 1980s opened, their market share in the growing minicomputer market failed to keep up with competitors, while other manufacturers were beginning to see impressive profits in the microcomputer space. The market for personal computers was dominated at the time by Tandy, Commodore, and Apple, whose machines sold for several hundred dollars each and had become very popular. The microcomputer market was large enough for IBM's attention, with \\$15 billion in sales by 1979 and projected annual growth of more than 40% during the early 1980s. Other large technology companies had entered it, such as Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments and Data General, and some large IBM customers were buying Apples.\n",
        "\n",
        "As early as 1980 there were rumors of IBM developing a personal computer, possibly a miniaturized version of the IBM System/370, and Matsushita acknowledged publicly that it had discussed with IBM the possibility of manufacturing a personal computer in partnership, although this project was abandoned. The public responded to these rumors with skepticism, owing to IBM's tendency towards slow-moving, bureaucratic business practices tailored towards the production of large, sophisticated and expensive business systems As with other large computer companies, its new products typically required about four to five years for development, and a well publicized quote from an industry analyst was, \"IBM bringing out a personal computer would be like teaching an elephant to tap dance.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "IBM had previously produced microcomputers, such as 1975's IBM 5100, but targeted them towards businesses; the 5100 had a price tag as high as \\$20,000. Their entry into the home computer market needed to be competitively priced.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the summer of 1979, Ron Mion, IBM’s Senior Business Trends Advisor for entry-level systems, proposed a plan for IBM to enter the emerging microcomputer market. At that time, the likes of Apple and Tandy were starting to encroach on the small-business marketplace that IBM intended to dominate. Mion believed that that market would grow significantly and that IBM should aggressively pursue it. However, he felt that they wouldn’t be successful unless IBM departed from its long-standing business model."
