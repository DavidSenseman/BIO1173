RMSprop is suitable for dealing with non-stationary objectives in regression tasks.\n",

        "* **Adagrad (Adaptive Gradient Algorithm):** An adaptive learning rate method that adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradients for that parameter.\n",
        "* **Adadelta:** An extension of Adagrad that seeks to alleviate Adagrad's aggressive, monotonically decreasing learning rate by using a running average of parameter updates.\n",

        "It is an efficient application of the chain rule to neural networks. Backpropagation computes the gradient of a loss function with respect to the weights of the network for a single input–output example, and does so efficiently, computing the gradient one layer at a time, iterating backward from the last layer to avoid redundant calculations of intermediate terms in the chain rule; this can be derived through dynamic programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "Strictly speaking, the term backpropagation refers only to an algorithm for efficiently computing the gradient, not how the gradient is used; but the term is often used loosely to refer to the entire learning algorithm – including how the gradient is used, such as by stochastic gradient descent, or as an intermediate step in a more complicated optimizer, such as Adaptive Moment Estimation.[5] The local minimum convergence, exploding gradient, vanishing gradient, and weak control of learning rate are main disadvantages of these optimization algorithms. The Hessian and quasi-Hessian optimizers solve only local minimum convergence problem, and the backpropagation works longer. These problems caused researchers to develop hybrid and fractional optimization algorithms.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The goal of any supervised learning algorithm is to find a function that best maps a set of inputs to their correct output. The motivation for backpropagation is to train a multi-layered neural network such that it can learn the appropriate internal representations to allow it to learn any arbitrary mapping of input to output.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Learning as an optimization problem**\n",
        "\n",
        "To understand the mathematical derivation of the backpropagation algorithm, it helps to first develop some intuition about the relationship between the actual output of a neuron and the correct output for a particular training example. Consider a simple neural network with two input units, one output unit and no hidden units, and in which each neuron uses a linear output (unlike most work on neural networks, in which mapping from inputs to outputs is non-linear) that is the weighted sum of its input.\n",
        "\n",
        "**History**\n",
        "\n",
        "Backpropagation had been derived repeatedly, as it is essentially an efficient application of the chain rule (first written down by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1676) to neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The terminology \"back-propagating error correction\" was introduced in 1962 by Frank Rosenblatt, but he did not know how to implement this. In any case, he only studied neurons whose outputs were discrete levels, which only had zero derivatives, making backpropagation impossible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Precursors to backpropagation appeared in optimal control theory since 1950s. Yann LeCun et al credits 1950s work by Pontryagin and others in optimal control theory, especially the adjoint state method, for being a continuous-time version of backpropagation. Hecht-Nielsen credits the Robbins–Monro algorithm (1951)[23] and Arthur Bryson and Yu-Chi Ho's Applied Optimal Control (1969) as presages of backpropagation. Other precursors were Henry J. Kelley 1960, and Arthur E. Bryson (1961). In 1962, Stuart Dreyfus published a simpler derivation based only on the chain rule. In 1973, he adapted parameters of controllers in proportion to error gradients. Unlike modern backpropagation, these precursors used standard Jacobian matrix calculations from one stage to the previous one, neither addressing direct links across several stages nor potential additional efficiency gains due to network sparsity.\n",
        "\n",
        "The ADALINE (1960) learning algorithm was gradient descent with a squared error loss for a single layer. The first multilayer perceptron (MLP) with more than one layer trained by stochastic gradient descent was published in 1967 by Shun'ichi Amari.[29] The MLP had 5 layers, with 2 learnable layers, and it learned to classify patterns not linearly separable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Modern backpropagation**\n",
        "\n",
        "Modern backpropagation was first published by Seppo Linnainmaa as \"reverse mode of automatic differentiation\" (1970) for discrete connected networks of nested differentiable functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 1982, Paul Werbos applied backpropagation to MLPs in the way that has become standard. Werbos described how he developed backpropagation in an interview. In 1971, during his PhD work, he developed backpropagation to mathematicize Freud's \"flow of psychic energy\". He faced repeated difficulty in publishing the work, only managing in 1981. He also claimed that \"the first practical application of back-propagation was for estimating a dynamic model to predict nationalism and social communications in 1974\" by him.\n",
        "\n",
        "Around 1982, David E. Rumelhart independently developed backpropagation and taught the algorithm to others in his research circle. He did not cite previous work as he was unaware of them. He published the algorithm first in a 1985 paper, then in a 1986 Nature paper an experimental analysis of the technique These papers became highly cited, contributed to the popularization of backpropagation, and coincided with the resurging research interest in neural networks during the 1980s.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 1985, the method was also described by David Parker. Yann LeCun proposed an alternative form of backpropagation for neural networks in his PhD thesis in 1987.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gradient descent took a considerable amount of time to reach acceptance. Some early objections were: there were no guarantees that gradient descent could reach a global minimum, only local minimum; neurons were \"known\" by physiologists as making discrete signals (0/1), not continuous ones, and with discrete signals, there is no gradient to take. See the interview with Geoffrey Hinton,[36] who was awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to the field.\n",
