    "\n",
    "The convolutional neural network (CNN) is a neural network technology that has profoundly impacted the area of computer vision (CV). Fukushima  (1980) [[Cite:fukushima1980neocognitron]](https://www.rctn.org/bruno/public/papers/Fukushima1980.pdf) introduced the original concept of a convolutional neural network, and   LeCun, Bottou, Bengio & Haffner (1998) [[Cite:lecun1995convolutional]](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-bengio-95a.pdf) greatly improved this work. From this research, Yan LeCun introduced the famous LeNet-5 neural network architecture. This chapter follows the LeNet-5 style of convolutional neural network.  \n",
    "Although computer vision primarily uses CNNs, this technology has some applications outside of the field. You need to realize that if you want to utilize CNNs on non-visual data, you must find a way to encode your data to mimic the properties of visual data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The order of the input array elements is crucial to the training. In contrast, most neural networks that are not CNNs treat their input data as a long vector of values, and the order in which you arrange the incoming features in this vector is irrelevant. You cannot change the order for these types of neural networks after you have trained the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CNN network arranges the inputs into a grid. This arrangement worked well with images because the pixels in closer proximity to each other are important to each other. The order of pixels in an image is significant. The human body is a relevant example of this type of order. For the design of the face, we are accustomed to eyes being near to each other. \n",

    "This advance in CNNs is due to years of research on biological eyes. In other words, CNNs utilize overlapping fields of input to simulate features of biological eyes. Until this breakthrough, AI had been unable to reproduce the capabilities of biological vision.\n",
    "Scale, rotation, and noise have presented challenges for AI computer vision research. You can observe the complexity of biological eyes in the example that follows. A friend raises a sheet of paper with a large number written on it. As your friend moves nearer to you, the number is still identifiable. In the same way, you can still identify the number when your friend rotates the paper. Lastly, your friend creates noise by drawing lines on the page, but you can still identify the number. As you can see, these examples demonstrate the high function of the biological eye and allow you to understand better the research breakthrough of CNNs. That is, this neural network can process scale, rotation, and noise in the field of computer vision. You can see this network structure in Figure 6.LENET.\n",

    "So far, we have only seen one layer type (dense layers). By the end of this book we will have seen:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dense Layers** - Fully connected layers.  \n",
    "* **Convolution Layers** - Used to scan across images. \n",
    "* **Max Pooling Layers** - Used to downsample images. \n",
    "* **Dropout Layers** - Used to add regularization. \n",
    "* **LSTM and Transformer Layers** - Used for time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convolution Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "The first layer that we will examine is the convolutional layer. We will begin by looking at the hyper-parameters that you must specify for a convolutional layer in most neural network frameworks that support the CNN:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Number of filters\n",
    "* Filter Size\n",
    "* Stride\n",
    "* Padding\n",
    "* Activation Function/Non-Linearity\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of a convolutional layer is to detect features such as edges, lines, blobs of color, and other visual elements. The filters can detect these features. The more filters we give to a convolutional layer, the more features it can see.\n",
    "\n",
    "A filter is a square-shaped object that scans over the image. A grid can represent the individual pixels of a grid. You can think of the convolutional layer as a smaller grid that sweeps left to right over each image row. There is also a hyperparameter that specifies both the width and height of the square-shaped filter. The following figure shows this configuration in which you see the six convolutional filters sweeping over the image grid:\n",
    "\n",
    "A convolutional layer has weights between it and the previous layer or image grid. Each pixel on each convolutional layer is a weight. Therefore, the number of weights between a convolutional layer and its predecessor layer or image field is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[FilterSize] * [FilterSize] * [# of Filters]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the filter size were 5 (5x5) for 10 filters, there would be 250 weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to understand how the convolutional filters sweep across the previous layer's output or image grid. Figure 6.CNN illustrates the sweep:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 6.CNN: Convolutional Neural Network**\n",
    "![Convolutional Neural Network](https://biologicslab.co/BIO1173/images/class_8_cnn_grid.png \"Convolutional Neural Network\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The above figure shows a convolutional filter with 4 and a padding size of 1. The padding size is responsible for the border of zeros in the area that the filter sweeps. Even though the image is 8x7, the extra padding provides a virtual image size of 9x8 for the filter to sweep across. The stride specifies the number of positions the convolutional filters will stop. The convolutional filters move to the right, advancing by the number of cells specified in the stride. Once you reach the far right, the convolutional filter moves back to the far left; then, it moves down by the stride amount and\n",
    "continues to the right again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some constraints exist concerning the size of the stride. The stride cannot be 0. The convolutional filter would never move if you set the stride. Furthermore, neither the stride nor the convolutional filter size can be larger than the previous grid. There are additional constraints on the stride (*s*), padding (*p*), and the filter width (*f*) for an image of width (*w*). Specifically, the convolutional filter must be able to start at the far left or top border, move a certain number of strides, and land on the far right or bottom border. The following equation shows the number of steps a convolutional operator\n",
    "must take to cross the image:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ steps = \\frac{w - f + 2p}{s}+1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of steps must be an integer. In other words, it cannot have decimal places. The purpose of the padding (*p*) is to be adjusted to make this equation become an integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Max Pooling Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Max-pool layers downsample a 3D box to a new one with smaller dimensions. Typically, you can always place a max-pool layer immediately following the convolutional layer. The LENET shows the max-pool layer immediately after layers C1 and C3. These max-pool layers progressively decrease the size of the dimensions of the 3D boxes passing through them. This technique can avoid overfitting (Krizhevsky, Sutskever & Hinton, 2012).\n",
    "\n",
    "A pooling layer has the following hyper-parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Spatial Extent (*f*)\n",
    "* Stride (*s*)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike convolutional layers, max-pool layers do not use padding. Additionally, max-pool layers have no weights, so training does not affect them. These layers downsample their 3D box input. The 3D box output by a max-pool layer will have a width equal to this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ w_2 = \\frac{w_1 - f}{s} + 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The height of the 3D box produced by the max-pool layer is calculated similarly with this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h_2 = \\frac{h_1 - f}{s} + 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The depth of the 3D box produced by the max-pool layer is equal to the depth the 3D box received as input. The most common setting for the hyper-parameters of a max-pool layer is f=2 and s=2. The spatial extent (f) specifies that boxes of 2x2 will be scaled down to single pixels. Of these four pixels, the pixel with the maximum value will represent the 2x2 pixel in the new grid. Because squares of size 4 are replaced with size 1, 75% of the pixel information is lost. The following figure shows this transformation as a 6x6 grid becomes a 3x3:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 6.MAXPOOL: Max Pooling Layer**\n",
    "![Max Pooling Layer](https://biologicslab.co/BIO1173/images/class_8_conv_maxpool.png \"Max Pooling Layer\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the above diagram shows each pixel as a single number. A grayscale image would have this characteristic. We usually take the average of the three numbers for an RGB image to determine which pixel has the maximum value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regression Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now look at two examples, one for regression and another for classification. For supervised computer vision, your dataset will need some labels. For classification, this label usually specifies what the image is a picture of. For regression, this \"label\" is some numeric quantity the image should produce, such as a count. We will look at two different means of providing this label.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first example will show how to handle regression with convolution neural networks. We will provide an image and expect the neural network to count items in that image. We will use a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jeffheaton/count-the-paperclips) that I created that contains a random number of paperclips. The following code will download this dataset for you.\n"
