        "To make the assignment more manageable, you will given a number of specific steps to perform. To help guide you in writing your code, you will be given a specific example in a particular class lesson that you can use for a reference. For example, in **Step 1: Download and Extract Data** you are given **REF: Class_01_6: Examples 1 & 2**. That means Examples 1 and 2 in `Class_01_6` provide code that you can use to complete that step of this assignment.\n",

        "\n",
        "In writing your code for this assignment, you are free to give your variables any name that makes sense to you. This includes the name of the DataFrame that holds your data. When you `copy-and-paste` code from earlier Class assignments, you always have to edit the name of the DataFrame to match the name you select for this assignment in **Step 1**.\n",
        "\n",
        "When it has been necessary to give an example that includes a DataFrame name, the DataFrame has been called `df` or `my_df`. You will need to edit these names to match the actual name you give to your DataFrame in **Step 1**.\n",

A small number of students in previous classes have flunked their assignment by using AI code that did not generate the correct output. Useless you give the AI a well-constructed prompt, the answer you get back might lead you in the wrong direction.\n",

        "**DeepSeek** (Chinese: 深度求索; pinyin: Shēndù Qiúsuǒ) is a Chinese artificial intelligence company that develops open-source large language models (LLMs). Based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, it is owned and funded by Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer, whose co-founder, Liang Wenfeng, established the company in 2023 and serves as its CEO.\n",
        "\n",
        "The DeepSeek-R1 model provides responses comparable to other contemporary large language models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4o and o1. It is trained at a significantly lower cost—stated at US$6 million compared to $100 million for OpenAI's GPT-4 in 2023—and approximately a tenth of the computing power used for Meta's comparable model, LLaMA 3.1. DeepSeek's AI models were developed amid United States sanctions on China and other countries for chips used to develop artificial intelligence, which were intended to restrict the ability of these countries to develop advanced AI systems. Lesser restrictions were later announced that would affect all but a few countries.\n",
        "\n",
        "On 10 January 2025, DeepSeek released its first free chatbot app, based on the DeepSeek-R1 model, for iOS and Android; by 27 January, DeepSeek had surpassed ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on the iOS App Store in the United States,[10] causing Nvidia's share price to drop by 18%. DeepSeek's success against larger and more established rivals has been described as \"upending AI\"[10] and ushering in \"a new era of AI brinkmanship\". DeepSeek's compliance with Chinese government censorship policies and its data collection practices have also raised concerns over privacy and information control in the model, prompting regulatory scrutiny in multiple countries.\n",
        "\n",
        "DeepSeek makes its generative artificial intelligence algorithms, models, and training details open-source, allowing its code to be freely available for use, modification, viewing, and designing documents for building purposes.However, reports indicate that the API version hosted in China applies content restrictions in accordance with local regulations, limiting responses on topics such as the Tiananmen Square massacre and Taiwan’s status. The company reportedly vigorously recruits young AI researchers from top Chinese universities, and hires from outside the computer science field to diversify its models' knowledge and abilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Background**\n",
        "\n",
        "In February 2016, High-Flyer was co-founded by AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng, who had been trading since the 2007–2008 financial crisis while attending Zhejiang University. They began stock-trading with a deep learning model running on GPU on October 21, 2016. Prior to this, they used CPU-based models, mainly linear models. Most trading was done by AI by the end of 2017.\n",
        "\n",
        "By 2019, he established High-Flyer as a hedge fund focused on developing and using AI trading algorithms. By 2021, High-Flyer exclusively used AI in trading, often using Nvidia chips. DeepSeek has made its generative artificial intelligence chatbot open source, meaning its code is freely available for use, modification, and viewing. This includes permission to access and use the source code, as well as design documents, for building purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2021, while running High-Flyer, Liang began stockpiling Nvidia GPUs for an AI project.[20] According to 36Kr, Liang had built up a store of 10,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs, which are used to train AI, before the United States federal government imposed AI chip restrictions on China.\n",
        "\n",
        "On 14 April 2023,[22] High-Flyer announced the start of an artificial general intelligence lab dedicated to research developing AI tools separate from High-Flyer's financial business. Incorporated on 17 July 2023, with High-Flyer as the investor and backer, the lab became its own company, DeepSeek. Venture capital firms were reluctant to provide funding, as they considered it unlikely that the venture would be able to generate an \"exit\" in a short period of time.\n",
        "\n",
        "On May 16, 2023, the company Beijing DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Basic Technology Research Co., Ltd. incorporated under the control of Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Basic Technology Research Co., Ltd. As of May 2024, Liang Wenfeng held 84% of DeepSeek through two shell corporations.\n",
        "\n",
        "After releasing DeepSeek-V2 in May 2024, which offered strong performance for a low price, DeepSeek became known as the catalyst for China's AI model price war. It was quickly dubbed the \"Pinduoduo of AI\", and other major tech giants such as ByteDance, Tencent, Baidu, and Alibaba began to cut the price of their AI models to compete with the company. Despite the low price charged by DeepSeek, it was profitable compared to its rivals that were losing money.\n",
        "\n",
        "DeepSeek is focused on research and has no detailed plans for commercialization, which also allows its technology to avoid the most stringent provisions of China's AI regulations, such as requiring consumer-facing technology to comply with the government's controls on information.\n",
        "\n",
        "DeepSeek's hiring preferences target technical abilities rather than work experience, resulting in most new hires being either recent university graduates or developers whose AI careers are less established. Likewise, the company recruits individuals without any computer science background to help its technology understand other topics and knowledge areas, including being able to generate poetry and perform well on the notoriously difficult Chinese college admissions exams (Gaokao).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Training framework**\n",
        "\n",
        "High-Flyer/DeepSeek has built at least two computing clusters, Fire-Flyer (萤火一号) and Fire-Flyer 2 (萤火二号). Fire-Flyer began construction in 2019 and finished in 2020, at a cost of 200 million yuan. It contained 1,100 GPUs interconnected at a rate of 200 Gbps. It was 'retired' after 1.5 years in operation. Fire-Flyer 2 began construction in 2021 with a budget of 1 billion yuan.[18] It was reported that in 2022, Fire-Flyer 2's capacity had been utilized at over 96%, totaling 56.74 million GPU hours.

        "# DeepSeek: A Comprehensive Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "DeepSeek is a Chinese artificial intelligence company that has rapidly emerged as a significant player in the global AI landscape. Founded in July 2023 and headquartered in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, the company has garnered international attention for developing large language models that rival those of leading Western AI companies—but at a fraction of the cost. The company's meteoric rise has been described as an \"AI Sputnik moment,\" challenging long-held assumptions about American dominance in the artificial intelligence industry.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Origins and Founding\n",
        "\n",
        "DeepSeek's origins trace back to High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform trading decisions. The hedge fund was co-founded in 2015 by Liang Wenfeng, who studied AI at Zhejiang University and began experimenting with trading while still a student. High-Flyer distinguished itself from other hedge funds through its early adoption of AI models for determining stock positions, building a talented team of AI researchers beginning in 2017.\n",
        "\n",
        "In April 2023, High-Flyer announced the establishment of an artificial general intelligence research lab dedicated to developing AI tools separate from its financial operations. By July 2023, this lab was incorporated as an independent company named DeepSeek, with High-Flyer serving as its principal investor and backer. Notably, venture capital investors were initially reluctant to fund the venture, skeptical that it could quickly generate profitable exits. The company received approximately $50 million in investment from High-Flyer and has operated without institutional or angel investors.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Technical Innovations and Cost Efficiency\n",
        "\n",
        "What sets DeepSeek apart from competitors is its remarkable cost efficiency. The company claims to have trained its V3 model for approximately $6 million—dramatically less than the estimated $100 million OpenAI spent on GPT-4 in 2023—while using roughly one-tenth the computing power consumed by comparable models like Meta's Llama 3.1.\n",
        "\n",
        "DeepSeek achieved this efficiency through several technical innovations. First, the company employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which functions like a team of specialists rather than a single generalist model. When processing a query, only the most relevant portions of the AI activate while the rest remain idle, significantly reducing computational demands.\n",
        "\n",
        "Second, DeepSeek optimized its models to run on Nvidia H800 GPUs—less powerful but more widely available chips that were designed for the Chinese market after U.S. export restrictions limited access to higher-performance H100 and A100 chips. The company used PTX, an assembly-like programming method that allows developers to control how AI interacts with hardware at a lower level, squeezing more performance from less powerful equipment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Third, DeepSeek reduced expensive human fine-tuning by automating much of the training process using reinforcement learning. While most AI models rely on large teams of human reviewers to manually refine responses, DeepSeek's approach allows the AI to learn more efficiently from experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Major Model Releases\n",
        "\n",
        "DeepSeek has released a series of increasingly capable models since its founding. The company's first model, DeepSeek Coder, launched in November 2023, followed by the DeepSeek-LLM series later that month. Throughout 2024, the company released specialized models including DeepSeek-MoE, DeepSeek-Math, and DeepSeek-V2.\n",
        "\n",
        "The breakthrough came in December 2024 with DeepSeek-V3, a model featuring 671 billion parameters that demonstrated superior reasoning skills and strong performance in coding and mathematics. According to internal benchmarks, V3 outperformed both openly available models like Meta's Llama and closed models like OpenAI's GPT-4o.\n",
        "\n",
        "In January 2025, DeepSeek released the R1 reasoning model alongside a consumer chatbot application. R1 employs a chain-of-thought approach similar to OpenAI's o1 model, solving problems by processing queries step by step. The model has been praised for its ability to tackle complex reasoning tasks, particularly in mathematics and coding, while effectively fact-checking itself to avoid common pitfalls.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Market Impact and Global Response\n",
        "\n",
        "The January 2025 release of DeepSeek's chatbot had immediate and dramatic consequences. Within days, the DeepSeek app surpassed ChatGPT as the most downloaded free application on Apple's U.S. App Store. By January 27, 2025, the company had accumulated approximately 22 million daily active users.\n",
        "\n",
        "The market reaction was swift and severe. On January 27, Nvidia's stock price plummeted 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in market capitalization—the largest single-day loss for any company in U.S. history. The broader technology sector experienced significant declines as investors reevaluated assumptions about AI infrastructure demand and the competitive landscape.\n",
        "\n",
        "The development raised questions about whether the U.S. could maintain its lead in artificial intelligence and whether the massive investments in AI chips would sustain their projected returns. In China, DeepSeek's success triggered a price war, compelling major tech companies including ByteDance, Tencent, Baidu, and Alibaba to significantly cut prices on their AI models.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Company Culture and Organization\n",
        "\n",
        "DeepSeek operates with a distinctly different culture from typical Chinese technology companies. Rather than adopting the industry-standard \"996\" work culture (9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week), DeepSeek fosters a meritocratic environment that prioritizes technical competence over extensive work experience. The company aggressively recruits doctoral AI researchers from top Chinese universities and frequently hires recent graduates. Interestingly, DeepSeek also employs individuals without computer science backgrounds to help its technology better understand diverse subjects.\n",
        "\n",
        "The company maintains a relatively small team of approximately 200 employees compared to OpenAI's 3,500. Most DeepSeek researchers finished their degrees within the past two years, bringing fresh perspectives and minimal corporate baggage. Former employees have described the work environment as offering abundant computing resources and freedom to experiment—opportunities rarely available to fresh graduates at other companies.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Challenges and Controversies\n",
        "\n",
        "DeepSeek faces several challenges and has attracted various controversies. The company operates under U.S. export controls that restrict access to advanced semiconductors. While High-Flyer acquired a substantial stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips before the anticipated sanctions—estimates range from 10,000 to 50,000 units—the company must now work with less powerful chips for new training runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Content moderation presents another challenge. DeepSeek's models have been noted for adhering to official Chinese Communist Party ideology and censorship guidelines, particularly in recent releases. Like other AI chatbots, DeepSeek's models struggle with fact-checking, exhibit tendencies to hallucinate information, and sometimes lack deep insight in areas requiring abstract thinking.\n",
        "\n",
        "The U.S. government has grown wary of potential foreign influence, with reports indicating plans to ban DeepSeek on government devices. The company delayed the release of its R2 model, initially planned for May 2025, due to challenges training it on domestically produced Huawei chips.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Future Outlook\n",
        "\n",
        "DeepSeek has stated that it focuses on research rather than immediate commercialization, positioning itself more like a nonprofit research organization than a typical technology company. This approach—ironically the opposite of OpenAI's trajectory from nonprofit to profit-driven enterprise—allows DeepSeek to prioritize fundamental AI research.\n",
        "\n",
        "Looking ahead, DeepSeek continues to release model updates and has published research detailing more efficient methods for AI development. While subsequent releases throughout 2025 have been viewed as incremental improvements rather than new shockwaves, analysts suggest more significant releases may be forthcoming. The company's success has demonstrated that powerful AI can be built through smarter software optimization rather than brute-force hardware acquisition, potentially reshaping the entire AI industry's approach to model development.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "DeepSeek represents a significant shift in the global AI landscape. By developing competitive large language models at dramatically lower costs despite hardware restrictions, the company has challenged assumptions about the requirements for advanced AI development. Whether DeepSeek's research-focused approach and efficiency-driven methodology will reshape the broader industry remains to be seen, but its impact on AI development strategies and market dynamics has already proven substantial."
