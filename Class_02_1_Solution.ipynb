        "**Neural networks** were one of the first machine learning models. Their popularity has fallen twice and is now on its third rise. **Deep learning** implies the use of neural networks. The \"deep\" in deep learning refers to a neural network with many hidden layers. Because neural networks have been around for so long, they have quite a bit of baggage. Researchers have created many different training algorithms, activation/transfer functions, and structures. This course is only concerned with the latest, most current state-of-the-art techniques for deep neural networks. We will not spend much time discussing the history of neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Neural networks accept input and produce output. The input to a neural network is called the **_feature vector_**. The size of this vector is always a fixed length. Changing the size of the feature vector usually means recreating the entire neural network. Though the feature vector is called a \"vector,\" this is not always the case. A vector implies a 1D array. Later we will learn about **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, which can allow the input size to change without retraining the neural network. Historically the input to a neural network was always 1D. However, with modern neural networks, you might see input data, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **1D vector** - Classic input to a neural network, similar to rows in a spreadsheet. Common in predictive modeling.\n",
        "* **2D Matrix** - Grayscale image input to a CNN.\n",
        "* **3D Matrix** - Color image input to a CNN.\n",
        "* **nD Matrix** - Higher-order input to a CNN.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before CNNs, programs either encoded images to an intermediate form or sent the image input to a neural network by merely squashing the image matrix into a long array by placing the image's rows side-by-side. CNNs are different as the matrix passes through the neural network layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Initially, this lesson will focus on 1D input to neural networks. However, later lessons will focus more heavily on higher dimension input.\n",
        "\n",
        "The term **dimension** can be confusing in neural networks. In the sense of a 1D input vector, dimension refers to how many elements are in that 1D array. For example, a neural network with ten input neurons has ten dimensions. However, now that we have CNNs, the input has dimensions. The input to the neural network will *usually* have 1, 2, or 3 dimensions. Four or more dimensions are unusual. You might have a 2D input to a neural network with 64x64 pixels. This configuration would result in 4,096 input neurons. This network is either 2D or 4,096D, depending on which dimensions you reference.\n"

A neural network algorithm is typically composed of individual, interconnected processing units, even though these units may or may not be called neurons. The terminology for these processing units varies across the literature—they may be called nodes, neurons, or units.\n",

It is also possible for a single neuron to fill the role of several different neuron types. Now we will explain all the neuron types described in the course.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are usually four types of neurons in a neural network:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Input Neurons** - We map each input neuron to one element in the feature vector.\n",
        "* **Hidden Neurons** - Hidden neurons allow the neural network to be abstract and process the input into the output.\n",
        "* **Output Neurons** - Each output neuron calculates one part of the output.\n",

The output neuron provides processed data from the network back to the program. The program will group these input and output neurons into separate layers called the input and output layers. The program normally represents the input to a neural network as an array or vector. The number of elements contained in the vector must equal the number of input neurons. For example, a neural network with three input neurons might accept the following input vector:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ [0.5, 0.75, 0.2] $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Neural networks typically accept floating-point vectors as their input. To be consistent, we will represent the output of a single output neuron network as a single-element vector. Likewise, neural networks will output a vector with a length equal to the number of output neurons. The output will often be a single value from a single output neuron.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Hidden Neurons**\n",
        "\n",
        "Hidden neurons have two essential characteristics. First, hidden neurons only receive input from other neurons, such as input or other hidden neurons. Second, hidden neurons only output to other neurons, such as output or other hidden neurons. Hidden neurons help the neural network understand the input and form the output. Programmers often group hidden neurons into fully connected hidden layers. However, these hidden layers do not directly process the incoming data or the eventual output.\n",
        "\n",
        "A common question for programmers concerns the number of hidden neurons in a network. Since the answer to this question is complex, more than one section of the course will include a relevant discussion of the number of hidden neurons. Before deep learning, researchers generally suggested that anything more than a single hidden layer is excessive. Researchers have proven that a single-hidden-layer neural network can function as a universal approximator. In other words, this network should be able to learn to produce (or approximate) any output from any input as long as it has enough hidden neurons in a single layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Training refers to the process that determines good weight values. Before the advent of deep learning, researchers feared additional layers would lengthen training time or encourage overfitting. Both concerns are true; however, increased hardware speeds and clever techniques can mitigate these concerns. Before researchers introduced deep learning techniques, we did not have an efficient way to train a deep network, which is a neural network with many hidden layers. Although a single-hidden-layer neural network can theoretically learn anything, deep learning facilitates a more complex representation of patterns in the data.  \n",

        "### **Bias Neurons**\n",
        "\n",
        "Programmers add bias neurons to neural networks to help them learn patterns. Bias neurons function like an input neuron that always produces a value of 1. Because the bias neurons have a constant output of 1, they are not connected to the previous layer. The value of 1, called the bias activation, can be set to values other than 1. However, 1 is the most common bias activation. Not all neural networks have bias neurons. The figure below shows a single-hidden-layer neural network with bias neurons:\n",

We might need the neural network to produce other values when the input is near 0.5.  \n",

        "* **Validation Loss (Orange):** This curve also decreases but is much \"noisier\" (jagged) than the training loss. It stabilizes around 0.08–0.10. Importantly, it does not begin to rise significantly, which tells us the model is generalizing well and is **not overfitting**.\n",

This is likely due to the **Dropout** layers used in our model (`nn.Dropout(0.3)`). Dropout randomly disables neurons during the *training* phase (making the task harder), but is turned off during the *validation* phase (allowing the model to use its full power)."

        "\n",
        "Fortran was originally developed by IBM. It first compiled correctly in 1958. Fortran computer programs have been written to support scientific and engineering applications, such as numerical weather prediction, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, plasma physics, geophysics, computational physics, crystallography and computational chemistry. It is a popular language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers.\n",

        "Fortran has evolved through numerous versions and dialects. In 1966, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) developed a standard for Fortran to limit proliferation of compilers using slightly different syntax. Successive versions have added support for a character data type (Fortran 77), structured programming, array programming, modular programming, generic programming (Fortran 90), parallel computing (Fortran 95), object-oriented programming (Fortran 2003), and concurrent programming (Fortran 2008).\n",

        "### **Naming**\n",
        "\n",
        "The first manual for FORTRAN describes it as a Formula Translating System, and printed the name with small caps, Fortran. Other sources suggest the name stands for Formula Translator, or Formula Translation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Early IBM computers did not support lowercase letters, and the names of versions of the language through FORTRAN 77 were usually spelled in all-uppercase. FORTRAN 77 was the last version in which the Fortran character set included only uppercase letters.\n",
        "\n",
        "The official language standards for Fortran have referred to the language as \"Fortran\" with initial caps since Fortran 90.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Origins**\n",
        "\n",
        "In late 1953, John W. Backus submitted a proposal to his superiors at IBM to develop a more practical alternative to assembly language for programming their IBM 704 mainframe computer.Backus' historic FORTRAN team consisted of programmers Richard Goldberg, Sheldon F. Best, Harlan Herrick, Peter Sheridan, Roy Nutt, Robert Nelson, Irving Ziller, Harold Stern, Lois Haibt, and David Sayre. Its concepts included easier entry of equations into a computer, an idea developed by J. Halcombe Laning and demonstrated in the Laning and Zierler system of 1952.\n",
        "\n",
        "A draft specification for The IBM Mathematical Formula Translating System was completed by November 1954. The first manual for FORTRAN appeared in October 1956,with the first FORTRAN compiler delivered in April 1957. Fortran produced efficient enough code for assembly language programmers to accept a high-level programming language replacement.\n",
        "\n",
        "John Backus said during a 1979 interview with Think, the IBM employee magazine, \"Much of my work has come from being lazy. I didn't like writing programs, and so, when I was working on the IBM 701, writing programs for computing missile trajectories, I started work on a programming system to make it easier to write programs.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The language was widely adopted by scientists for writing numerically intensive programs, which encouraged compiler writers to produce compilers that could generate faster and more efficient code. The inclusion of a complex number data type in the language made Fortran especially suited to technical applications such as electrical engineering.\n",
        "\n",
        "By 1960, versions of FORTRAN were available for the IBM 709, 650, 1620, and 7090 computers. Significantly, the increasing popularity of FORTRAN spurred competing computer manufacturers to provide FORTRAN compilers for their machines, so that by 1963 over 40 FORTRAN compilers existed.\n",
        "\n",
        "FORTRAN was provided for the IBM 1401 computer by an innovative 63-phase compiler that ran entirely in its core memory of only 8000 (six-bit) characters. The compiler could be run from tape, or from a 2200-card deck; it used no further tape or disk storage. It kept the program in memory and loaded overlays that gradually transformed it, in place, into executable form, as described by Haines.[21] This article was reprinted, edited, in both editions of Anatomy of a Compiler[22] and in the IBM manual \"Fortran Specifications and Operating Procedures, IBM 1401\".[23] The executable form was not entirely machine language; rather, floating-point arithmetic, sub-scripting, input/output, and function references were interpreted, preceding UCSD Pascal P-code by two decades. GOTRAN, a simplified, interpreted version of FORTRAN I (with only 12 statements not 32) for \"load and go\" operation was available (at least for the early IBM 1620 computer).[24] Modern Fortran, and almost all later versions, are fully compiled, as done for other high-performance languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "The development of Fortran paralleled the early evolution of compiler technology, and many advances in the theory and design of compilers were specifically motivated by the need to generate efficient code for Fortran programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Fortran – A Comprehensive Overview**\n",
        "\n",
        "Fortran (short for **FORmula TRANslating System**) is one of the oldest high‑level programming languages, designed in the 1950s to simplify scientific and engineering calculations. Created by IBM’s John Backus and his team, the first official version (FORTRAN 66) appeared in 1966, providing a syntax that allowed programmers to express mathematical formulas in a form close to textbook notation. Over the decades, Fortran has evolved through several revisions—FORTRAN 77, FORTRAN 90/95, FORTRAN 2003, FORTRAN 2008, and the most recent FORTRAN 2018—each adding features that reflect the changing needs of scientific computing while preserving backward compatibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Historical Context and Evolution**#\n",
        "\n",
        "- **FORTRAN 66**: The inaugural standard focused on array processing, loops, and conditional statements. It introduced the `DO` loop and `IF` statements, making it easier to write numerical routines.\n",
        "- **FORTRAN 77**: Added structured programming constructs, implicit typing rules, and subroutines/functions with explicit interfaces. It introduced format statements for I/O and the concept of “common blocks” for shared data.\n",
        "- **FORTRAN 90/95**: Marked a paradigm shift toward modern programming practices. These revisions introduced modules, allocatable arrays, pointer semantics, and array operations. They also dropped implicit typing, making the language more explicit and safer.\n",
        "- **FORTRAN 2003**: Integrated object‑oriented programming (OOP) features such as type extension, type-bound procedures, and polymorphism. It also added interoperability with C via the `ISO_C_BINDING` module, facilitating mixed‑language projects.\n",
        "- **FORTRAN 2008**: Brought additional parallel computing constructs, including coarrays for distributed memory parallelism, and improved the language’s support for modern hardware.\n",
        "- **FORTRAN 2018**: Finalizes the standard with enhancements to parallelism, interoperability, and language pragmas, making Fortran a viable choice for high‑performance computing (HPC) on contemporary supercomputers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Core Language Features**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Declarative Style**: Fortran emphasizes mathematical expressions. Variables are declared with explicit types (`INTEGER`, `REAL`, `DOUBLE PRECISION`, `COMPLEX`, `LOGICAL`, `CHARACTER`) and kinds.\n",
        "2. **Array Operations**: Native support for whole‑array operations (`A = B + C`) and array slicing (`A(1:10, :)`) reduces boilerplate code and improves performance.\n",
        "3. **Modules and Encapsulation**: Modules encapsulate data and procedures, enabling namespace control and reusable libraries.\n",
        "4. **Implicit Typing (Optional)**: By default, variables starting with letters I–N are integers, others real. This can be overridden with `IMPLICIT NONE` to enforce explicit typing.\n",
        "5. **Structured Control Flow**: `IF`, `SELECT CASE`, `DO` loops, `WHERE` for element‑wise selection, and `FORALL` for array assignments.\n",
        "6. **I/O Flexibility**: Formatted and unformatted I/O through `READ`/`WRITE` statements with `FORMAT` specifiers, allowing both human‑readable and binary data handling.\n",
        "7. **Pointer and Allocatable Variables**: Enable dynamic memory allocation and flexible data structures.\n",
        "8. **Coarrays**: Introduced in Fortran 2008, coarrays provide a language‑level abstraction for parallelism, allowing the programmer to express data distribution and synchronization with minimal boilerplate.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Typical Use Cases**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Scientific Simulations**: Climate modeling, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), astrophysics, and molecular dynamics.\n",
        "- **Numerical Libraries**: BLAS, LAPACK, FFTW (Fortran bindings), and PETSc (Fortran interfaces) rely on Fortran for performance‑critical routines.\n",
        "- **Legacy Codebases**: Many national laboratories and universities maintain massive Fortran code repositories; maintaining and extending them requires modern Fortran expertise.\n",
        "- **High‑Performance Computing**: Modern compilers (Intel, GNU, Fujitsu) generate highly optimized machine code, and features like coarrays map efficiently onto MPI/OpenMP backends.\n",
        "- **Interoperability Projects**: Using `ISO_C_BINDING`, Fortran can call C libraries and vice versa, facilitating integration with Python (via f2py) or other languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Interoperability and Ecosystem**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **C Interoperability**: `ISO_C_BINDING` module exposes C types (`C_INT`, `C_DOUBLE`) and allows Fortran procedures to be declared `BIND(C)` so they can be called from C. This has become a cornerstone of hybrid language projects.\n",
        "- **Python Bindings**: Tools like `f2py` (part of NumPy) let Python import Fortran routines as modules, bridging the gap between scientific Python and legacy Fortran performance.\n",
        "- **MPI and OpenMP**: Fortran compilers support MPI and OpenMP pragmas, making it straightforward to write parallel codes that run on clusters and multi‑core processors.\n",
        "- **Unit Testing Frameworks**: Projects such as `fassert` and `UnitTestFortran` provide a testing infrastructure, encouraging modern software practices.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example Code**\n",
