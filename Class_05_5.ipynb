        "Quite a few hyperparameters have been introduced so far.  Tweaking each of these values can have an effect on the score obtained by your neural networks.  Some of the hyperparameters seen so far include:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Number of layers in the neural network\n",

        "* L1 and L2 values on each layer\n",
        "\n",
        "To try out each of these hyperparameters you will need to run train neural networks with multiple settings for each hyperparameter.  However, you may have noticed that neural networks often produce somewhat different results when trained multiple times.  This is because the neural networks start with random weights.  Because of this it is necessary to fit and evaluate a neural network several times to ensure that one set of hyperparameters are actually better than another.  **_Bootstrapping_** can be an effective means of benchmarking (comparing) two sets of hyperparameters.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Bootstrapping is similar to cross-validation.  Both go through a number of cycles/folds providing validation and training sets.  However, bootstrapping can have an unlimited number of cycles.  Bootstrapping chooses a new train and validation split each cycle, with **_replacement_**.  The fact that each cycle is chosen with replacement means that, unlike cross validation, there will often be repeated rows selected between cycles.  If you run the bootstrap for enough cycles, there will be duplicate cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this part we will use bootstrapping for **_hyperparameter benchmarking_**.  We will train a neural network for a specified number of splits (denoted by the SPLITS constant).  For these examples we use 100.  We will compare the average score at the end of the 100th epoch.  By the end of the cycles the mean score will have converged somewhat.  This ending score will be a much better basis of comparison than a single cross-validation.  Additionally, the average number of epochs will be tracked to give an idea of a possible optimal value.  Because the early stopping validation set is also used to evaluate the the neural network as well, it might be slightly inflated.  This is because we are both stopping and evaluating on the same sample.  However, we are using the scores only as relative measures to determine the superiority of one set of hyperparameters to another, so this slight inflation should not present too much of a problem.\n",

        "\"Balancing\" isn't necessary when performing regression. As long as the data is shuffled, any data sample should have roughtly the same distribution of high, low and medium values. But this is not necessarily true when it come to classification, especially if the number of items/subjects/patients in each class is significantly different. Even if the data is shuffled, there is some possibility that the random selection might inadvertly include too many samples from one class and not enough samples from a another class.\n",

And suppose that the number of `Asian` subjects is significantly smaller that the number of `white` subjects. If you randomly selected a subset of this dataset (what is called **Simple Random Sampling** in statistics), you might end up with a sample with very few or even no `Asian` subjects, and a disproportionate high number of `white` subjects. Training your neural network on this unbalanced subset sample would give you very bad results when tested later on a more general population sample.\n",
