    "\n",
    "Starting with this lesson, Class_01_3, you are free to choose whether to use Jupyterlab Notebook, Google COLAB or any combination, for your lessons and assignments in this course. Like most things in life, there are trade offs when you choose one over the other. If you plan to do most of your work in this class on an older, low-power laptop, then I would recommend that you use COLAB. On the other hand, if you plan to do most of your work on a fairly powerful gaming PC or one of the newer, bigger MacBooks, you might want to use Jupyterlab. If you are a real \"computer jock\" running the latest Ubuntu, you don't need any advice from me. \n",

    "* **Cloud Storage:** Google Colab integrates seamlessly with Google Drive, allowing for easy access to files and datasets stored in the cloud compared to managing files locally on a PC or MacBook.\n",
    "* **Pre-installed Libraries:** Google Colab comes pre-installed with popular data science libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, saving time on installing and configuring libraries compared to setting up a local environment on a PC or MacBook.\n",

    "* **Customization:** You have more control over the environment and settings when using Jupyter Lab on your own PC or MacBook, allowing you to customize the setup to suit your specific workflow and preferences compared to the limitations of a cloud-based platform like Google Colab.\n",
    "* **Data Privacy:** Working on your own PC or MacBook ensures that your sensitive data and code remain on your local machine, providing an added layer of privacy and security compared to working on a cloud-based platform like Google Colab where data is stored in the cloud.\n",
    "* **Hardware Access:** You have direct access to the hardware resources of your own PC or MacBook, allowing you to leverage any upgrades or specialized hardware configurations you may have for improved performance compared to relying on the resources provided by Google Colab.\n",
