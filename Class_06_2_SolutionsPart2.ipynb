        "\n",
        "**1. Conversion Was Successful**\n",
        "\n",
        "The most important takeaway is that **the Blue bars (PyTorch) and Orange bars (ONNX) are perfectly aligned.**\n",
        "* For every class shown (Class 0 through Class 4), the height of the ONNX prediction matches the PyTorch prediction exactly.\n",
        "* This visually confirms what the `np.allclose` code check told you earlier: the ONNX model is replicating the original model's behavior with high precision.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. You Are Viewing \"Logits\" (Raw Scores)**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Y-axis shows values ranging from roughly **-1.5 to +1.0**.\n",
        "* Because there are **negative numbers** (Class 3 and Class 4), you are looking at **Logits** (raw model outputs before activation) rather than Probabilities.\n",
        "* If these were probabilities (after a Softmax layer), all bars would be between 0 and 1, and they would sum up to 1.0.\n",
        "* Comparing logits is actually **better** for debugging because Softmax can sometimes hide small numerical differences by \"squashing\" values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Class Breakdown**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Class 0:** Has the highest score (~1.0), meaning both models predict this is the most likely class among these five.\n",
        "* **Class 3 & 4:** Have negative scores, meaning the model is confident these are *not* the correct classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion**\n",
        "Your ONNX model is effectively a \"digital twin\" of your PyTorch model. It is safe to proceed to deployment or performance optimization (like quantization) because you have verified that the accuracy has not been lost during conversion."

        "    * Visually, the **PyTorch matrix (Blue)** and **ONNX matrix (Green)** are identical. This proves the ONNX model reproduces the PyTorch model's behavior across the entire dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Model Behavior (The \"Odd\" News):**\n",
        "    * You will notice **all predictions fall into \"Class 0\"** (the first column). The model predicted Class 0 for every single test sample (blue), and never predicted Classes 1-4 (green).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Why is the Model Only Predicting Class 0?**\n",
        "\n",
        "This \"Class 0 collapse\" is likely due to two compounding factors:\n",
        "* **Training Data Imbalance:** a majority of your original training images were from Class 0. This causes the model to learn a strong **prior bias**—it learns that \"when in doubt, guess Class 0\" is the statistically safest bet.\n",
        "* **Random Input Data:** Since we are testing with generated noise (`np.random.randn`) rather than real images, the model detects no recognizable features for any class. Lacking evidence, it reverts to its learned bias (Class 0).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion**\n",
        "We have **successfully converted the model.** Even though the predictions themselves are skewed due to data imbalance and random inputs, the **ONNX model is failing in _exactly_ the same way as the PyTorch model**, which is the definition of a successful conversion. In other words, **our PyTorch model is _not_ very good at classifying retinal fundus images into diabetic retinoptic categories**."

        "Besides accuracy, one would like to know if one model type runs \"faster\" than another. In other words, if we train a PyTorch model using Nvidia GPU hardware acceleration, does the ONNX version of the model run significatly faster (or slower)? Using a trained model to provide predictions is called **inference**. When you ask `ChatGPT` a question, the answer is an example of `inference` so it's important that a model can \"run fast\".\n",

        "\n",
        "The answer lies in two critical benefits: **Flexibility (Portability)** and **Speed**.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **1. Flexibility: The \"Universal Translator\"**\n",
        "In the modern AI landscape, you rarely deploy on the exact same hardware you used for training. You might train on a massive Google TPU cluster, but deploy to an edge device, a cloud server, or a user's laptop.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Without ONNX**, you are often locked into the framework (PyTorch/TensorFlow) and the specific hardware drivers it supports.\n",
        "\n",
        "**With ONNX**, your model becomes a standard file format that acts as a \"digital universal adapter.\" It decouples the **Model Architecture** from the **Hardware Execution**. The ONNX Runtime connects to specific **Hardware Accelerators** via \"Execution Providers\":\n",
        "\n",
        "* **NVIDIA GPUs:** via `CUDAExecutionProvider` or `TensorRT` (Standard for cloud inference)\n",
        "* **Google TPUs:** via `XLA` or `TPUExecutionProvider` (High throughput training/inference)\n",
        "* **Intel CPUs/iGPUs:** via `OpenVINO` (Optimized for standard servers and laptops)\n",
        "* **AMD GPUs:** via `ROCmExecutionProvider`\n",
        "* **Apple Silicon (Mac/iPhone):** via `CoreMLExecutionProvider`\n",
        "* **Mobile/Edge (Android/Qualcomm):** via `NNAPI` or `QNN`\n",
        "\n",
        "This means you can train once on a TPU, convert to ONNX, and deploy that *exact same file* to an Android phone, a MacBook, or an Nvidia H100 server without rewriting your model code.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **2. Speed: The \"Graph Optimizer\"**\n",
        "As we saw in our benchmark (1.28x speedup), ONNX often runs faster than the original framework. This happens for three main reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Operator Fusion:** ONNX Runtime analyzes the entire model graph before running it. It merges separate mathematical operations (like `Convolution` + `BatchNorm` + `ReLU`) into a single kernel call. This drastically reduces \"memory bandwidth pressure\"—the time spent moving data back and forth between memory and the processor.\n",
        "2.  **Removing Training Overhead:** PyTorch and TensorFlow keep track of metadata required for backpropagation (training). ONNX strips all of this away, leaving only the pure mathematics needed for inference (prediction).\n",
        "3.  **Hardware-Specific Tuning:** When you select a specific provider (like CUDA or TensorRT), ONNX Runtime can auto-tune the mathematical operations to exploit the specific architecture of that chip (e.g., using Tensor Cores on Nvidia GPUs efficiently).\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Summary:** Converting to ONNX essentially _compiles_ your model for production, ensuring it runs as fast as possible on whatever hardware is available."
