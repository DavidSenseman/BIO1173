    "It can be difficult to determine how many epochs to cycle through to train a neural network. **_Overfitting_** will occur if you train the neural network for too many epochs, and the neural network will not perform well on new data, despite attaining a good accuracy on the training set. Overfitting occurs when a neural network is trained to the point that it begins to memorize rather than generalize, as demonstrated in Figure 3.OVER. \n",

This attempts to stop at a near-optimal training point. This method will only give accurate \"out of sample\" predictions for the validation set; this is usually 20% of the data. The predictions for the training data will be overly optimistic, as these were the data that we used to train the neural network. Figure 3.VAL demonstrates how we divide the dataset.\n",

    "### Example 1: Early Stopping with Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in the cell below builds and trains a **_classification_** neural network called `irisModel`. The model is trained/fitted to the Iris flower dataset (`iris.csv`) downloaded from the course HTTPS server and stored in the DataFrame `irisDF`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The independent variables, or X-values, are the values in the columns `sepal_length`, `sepal_width`, `petal_length` and `petal_width`. The values are store in a Numpy array called `irisX`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dependent variable (Y-value) is the column `species` which contains the names of the three Iris species in the dataset, _Iris setosa_, _Iris_ versicolor_ and _Iris virginica_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the species names are entered in the `species` column as strings, it is necessary to use One-Hot Encoding to convert these strings into the values `0` and `1` using the command `pd.get_dummies()`. The variable holding the dependent values, `irisY`, is created from the `dummies.values` as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Early Stopping\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement _Early Stopping_, it is first necessary to split the dataset into 4 separate groups: X train, X test, Y train and Y test using the function `train_test_split()`. The argument `test_size=0.25` tells the function that 75% of the data should be put into the two train sets (i.e. `irisX_train` and `irisY_train`) and the remaining 25% should be put into the two validation sets `irisX_test` and `irisY_test`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the separation of data into training and test sets is a random process, the argument `random_state=42` is used for teaching/demonstration purposes to insure that the `split` occurs at the same places when the code is re-run. In normal use, you wouldn't set the random seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model, `irisModel`, is a densely connected sequential neural network with two hidden layers. The 1st layer has 50 neurons, the 2nd hidden layer 25. The activation function for both hidden layers is `relu`. Since this function of this model is classification, the `softmax` activation function is used in the output layer. The model is compiled with the 'categorical_crossentropy` loss function and the `adam` optimizer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code for implementing early stopping variable `irisMoniter` is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~text\n",
    "# Build monitor for early stopping\n",
    "irisMonitor = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', min_delta=1e-3, patience=5, \n",
    "        verbose=1, mode='auto', restore_best_weights=True)\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "The meaning/function of the different arguments will be discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the model is fitted to the Iris data with the number of epochs set to **1000!** Don't worry, you won't have to wait forever for the training to complete--thanks to early stopping."

    "\n",
    "Clearly, the ability to stop training when the loss function on the validation training set reaches a minimum can save a significant amount of time. However, perhaps more importantly, Early Stopping can prevent a neural network from **_overtraining_**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overtraining occurs when the neural network can predict training examples with very high accuracy but cannot generalize to new data. In other words, the neural network starts learning **_specific details_** about the training data. While this improves the model's loss function in the particular training set, it will actually performs worse when presented with new data that it hasn't seen before. \n"
