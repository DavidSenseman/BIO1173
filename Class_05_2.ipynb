        "While this lesson takes a fair amount of time to run, due to training time of the neural networks, this particular lesson does **not** run any faster if you use the \"fancy\" (i.e. expensive) runtime options like \"A100\" or \"VT100 GPU\", or even the free \"T4 GPU\". For example, the first neural network in this lesson required 11 minutes and 8 seconds to run with the expensive \"TPU\" runtime, but only 11 minutes and 1 second using the default \"CPU\".  \n",
        "\n",
        "So why doesn't using a GPU or TPU (tensor processing unit) help? Simple 3 layer neural networks, like those used in this lesson, may not run faster with GPU support because the network is not complex enough to fully utilize the parallel processing power of a GPU. GPUs are best suited for handling very large and complex neural networks with multiple layers and thousands of neurons. In this case, the overhead of transferring data between the CPU and GPU may outweigh the potential speedup gained from GPU parallelism, resulting in minimal performance improvement or even slower execution times."

        "\n",
        "Regression and classification are handled somewhat differently concerning cross-validation. Regression is the simpler case where you can break up the data set into K folds with little regard for where each item lands. For regression, the data items should fall into the folds as randomly as possible. It is also important to remember that not every fold will necessarily have the same number of data items. It is not always possible for the data set to be evenly divided into K folds. For regression cross-validation, we will use the Scikit-Learn class **KFold**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cross-validation for classification could also use the **KFold** object; however, this technique would not ensure that the class balance remains the same in each fold as in the original. The balance of classes that a model was trained on must remain the same (or similar) to the training set. Drift in this distribution is one of the most important things to monitor after a trained model has been placed into actual use. Because of this, we want to make sure that the cross-validation itself does not introduce an unintended shift. This technique is called stratified sampling and is accomplished by using the Scikit-Learn object **StratifiedKFold** in place of **KFold** whenever you use classification. In summary, you should use the following two objects in Scikit-Learn:\n",
