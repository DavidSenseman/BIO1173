GPUs are best suited for handling very large and complex neural networks with multiple layers and thousands of neurons. In this case, the overhead of transferring data between the CPU and GPU may outweigh the potential speedup gained from GPU parallelism, resulting in minimal performance improvement or even slower execution times.\n",

        "\n",
        "**_K-fold validation_** is a technique used in machine learning to evaluate the performance and generalization ability of a model. In K-fold validation, the original dataset is randomly partitioned into K equal-sized subsets. The model is trained and evaluated K times, with each iteration using a different subset as the validation set and the remaining subsets as the training set. This allows for a more robust evaluation of the model's performance as it reduces the variance that may result from using a single train-test split. The final performance metric is typically averaged over the K iterations for a more reliable estimation of the model's performance.\n",

        "\n",
        "It is important to note that each fold will have one model (neural network). To generate predictions for new data (not present in the training set), predictions from the fold models can be handled in several ways:\n",

        "\n",
        "Generally, I prefer the last approach and will retrain a model on the entire data set once I have selected hyper-parameters. Of course, I will always set aside a final holdout set for model validation that I do not use in any aspect of the training process.\n",

        "## Regression vs Classification K-Fold Cross-Validation\n",
        "\n",
        "Regression and classification are handled somewhat differently concerning cross-validation. Regression is the simpler case where you can break up the data set into K folds with little regard for where each item lands. For regression, the data items should fall into the folds as randomly as possible. It is also important to remember that not every fold will necessarily have the same number of data items. It is not always possible for the data set to be evenly divided into K folds. For regression cross-validation, we will use the Scikit-Learn class **KFold**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cross-validation for classification could also use the **KFold** object; however, this technique would not ensure that the class balance remains the same in each fold as in the original. The balance of classes that a model was trained on must remain the same (or similar) to the training set. Drift in this distribution is one of the most important things to monitor after a trained model has been placed into actual use. Because of this, we want to make sure that the cross-validation itself does not introduce an unintended shift. This technique is called stratified sampling and is accomplished by using the Scikit-Learn object **StratifiedKFold** in place of **KFold** whenever you use classification. In summary, you should use the following two objects in Scikit-Learn:\n",
