    "You can use cross-validation for a variety of purposes in predictive modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generating out-of-sample predictions from a neural network\n",
    "* Estimate a good number of epochs to train a neural network for (early stopping)\n",
    "* Evaluate the effectiveness of certain hyperparameters, such as activation functions, neuron counts, and layer counts\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation uses several folds and multiple models to provide each data segment a chance to serve as both the validation and training set. Figure 5.CROSS shows cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 5.CROSS: K-Fold Crossvalidation**\n",
    "![K-Fold Crossvalidation](https://biologicslab.co/BIO1173/images/class_1_kfold.png \"K-Fold Crossvalidation\")\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that each fold will have one model (neural network). To generate predictions for new data (not present in the training set), predictions from the fold models can be handled in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Choose the model with the highest validation score as the final model.\n",
    "* Preset new data to the five models (one for each fold) and average the result (this is an [ensemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning)).\n",
    "* Retrain a new model (using the same settings as the cross-validation) on the entire dataset. Train for as many epochs and with the same hidden layer structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, I prefer the last approach and will retrain a model on the entire data set once I have selected hyper-parameters. Of course, I will always set aside a final holdout set for model validation that I do not use in any aspect of the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regression vs Classification K-Fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression and classification are handled somewhat differently concerning cross-validation. Regression is the simpler case where you can break up the data set into K folds with little regard for where each item lands. For regression, the data items should fall into the folds as randomly as possible. It is also important to remember that not every fold will necessarily have the same number of data items. It is not always possible for the data set to be evenly divided into K folds. For regression cross-validation, we will use the Scikit-Learn class **KFold**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation for classification could also use the **KFold** object; however, this technique would not ensure that the class balance remains the same in each fold as in the original. The balance of classes that a model was trained on must remain the same (or similar) to the training set. Drift in this distribution is one of the most important things to monitor after a trained model has been placed into actual use. Because of this, we want to make sure that the cross-validation itself does not introduce an unintended shift. This technique is called stratified sampling and is accomplished by using the Scikit-Learn object **StratifiedKFold** in place of **KFold** whenever you use classification. In summary, you should use the following two objects in Scikit-Learn:\n",
