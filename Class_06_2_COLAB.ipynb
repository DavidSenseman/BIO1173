Depthwise convolutions apply a single filter for each input channel, while pointwise convolutions apply 1x1 convolutions to combine the outputs of depthwise convolutions.\n",

Inverted residuals use an expansion layer to increase the number of channels followed by a depthwise convolution and a projection layer to reduce the number of channels back to the original dimensions.\n",

It is certainly possible to train a neural network to do this for example [MonarchNet](https://ai4earthscience.github.io/neurips-2020-workshop/papers/ai4earth_neurips_2020_57.pdf).

    "\n",
    "MobileNet and ResNet are both popular deep learning architectures, but they have some key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Architecture:** MobileNet uses depthwise separable convolutions, which consist of depthwise convolutions and pointwise convolutions, to reduce the computational cost and make the model more efficient for mobile and embedded applications. ResNet, on the other hand, uses residual blocks with skip connections to learn residual mappings for easier training of deep networks.\n",
    "* **Model size:** MobileNet is known for its lightweight and compact design, making it easy to deploy on mobile devices with limited computational resources. In contrast, ResNet is a deeper network with more parameters, which can lead to higher accuracy but also requires more computational resources.\n",
    "* **Training complexity:** ResNet can be easier to train compared to MobileNet, especially for deeper architectures, due to the use of skip connections that help with gradient flow and alleviate the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "* **Performance:** ResNet is often used for tasks that require high accuracy, such as image classification on large datasets like ImageNet. MobileNet is designed for efficiency and speed, making it suitable for real-time applications on mobile devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the choice between MobileNet and ResNet depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as computational resources, accuracy goals, and deployment constraints.\n",
