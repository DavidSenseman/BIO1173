        "* **Training Behavior:** The Training Loss (Blue) drops consistently and smoothly from `0.65` down to `0.24`. The model keeps learning the training data better and better.\n",
        "* **Validation Behavior:** The Validation Loss (Orange) drops quickly at first, but hits a \"floor\" around **Epoch 5**. After that, it stays stuck around `0.45` for the remaining 45 epochs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Diagnosis: Overfitting (High Variance)**\n",
        "* The model is **memorizing** the training data.\n",
        "* It continues to improve on the data it has seen (Blue line goes down), but it is failing to translate that improvement to new data (Orange line stays flat).\n",
        "* **Correction:** You are wasting computational resources after Epoch 5. You should likely stop training earlier (\"Early Stopping\") or increase regularization (Dropout/L2) to force the Blue and Orange lines closer together.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Model Accuracy (Right Graph)**\n",
        "**Observation:**\n",
        "* **Tight Convergence:** The Blue and Orange lines track each other very closely.\n",
        "* **Val > Train (The \"Cross-over\"):** You might notice that in the first 10-15 epochs, the Validation Accuracy (Orange) is actually **higher** than the Training Accuracy (Blue).\n",
        "    * *Why?* This is common when using **Dropout**. Dropout \"cripples\" the neural network during training (making it harder to learn), but is turned off during validation (allowing the full network to work). This gives the validation metrics a slight artificial boost compared to training metrics.\n",
        "* **Jagged Lines:** The Validation line is \"stepped\" or jagged. This indicates a **small validation dataset**. A single misclassified point causes a noticeable jump in the percentage.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Diagnosis: Excellent Fit**\n",
        "* This model is **healthy**.\n",
        "* The fact that the Validation Loss drops extremely low (`< 0.1`) alongside the Training Loss proves the model has learned the actual rules of the data, not just the noise.\n",
        "* The slight uptick in Validation Loss at the very end (Epoch 28-30) suggests mild overfitting is *just starting* to begin, so stopping around Epoch 25-30 is perfect."

This indicates a very high correlation coefficient ($R^2$), meaning your model explains the variance in the target variable (`mean_area`) extremely well.\n",
        "* **Linearity:** The relationship is clearly linear across the entire range of values (from approx. 100 to 220). There is no obvious curvature, suggesting the neural network has successfully captured the linear relationship between the input features and the target.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Bias and Variance**\n",

        "**Subtle Observations**\n",
        "* **Slight Heteroscedasticity:** If you look closely at the higher values (top right, area > 180), the points are slightly more spread out compared to the lower values (bottom left, area < 120). This is common in regression; predicting larger values often comes with slightly higher absolute error than predicting smaller, more common values.\n",
        "* **Outliers:** There are very few significant outliers. One point around `Actual=210` is slightly under-predicted, but it is still reasonably close to the line.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion**\n",

        "* **High Variance:** The blue points are spread far away from the red line. For example, for an **Actual Value of 130**, the model predicts values ranging anywhere from **110 to 170**. This indicates a high error margin for individual predictions.\n",

        "* **Under-predicting High Values:** Look at the right side (Actual > 160). Most blue points are *below* the red line. The model fails to capture the severity of the highest cases.\n",

        "J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly built the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering between 1943 and 1946. A 1946 patent rights dispute with the university led Eckert and Mauchly to depart the Moore School to form the Electronic Control Company, later renamed Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation (EMCC), based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. That company first built a computer called BINAC (BINary Automatic Computer) for Northrop Aviation (which was little used, or perhaps not at all). Afterwards, the development of UNIVAC began in April 1946.[1] UNIVAC was first intended for the Bureau of the Census, which paid for much of the development, and then was put in production.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the death of EMCC's chairman and chief financial backer Henry L. Straus in a plane crash on October 25, 1949, EMCC was sold to typewriter, office machine, electric razor, and gun maker Remington Rand on February 15, 1950. Eckert and Mauchly now reported to Leslie Groves, the retired army general who had previously managed building The Pentagon and led the Manhattan Project.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most famous UNIVAC product was the UNIVAC I mainframe computer of 1951, which became known for predicting the outcome of the U.S. presidential election the following year: this incident is noteworthy because the computer correctly predicted an Eisenhower landslide over Adlai Stevenson, whereas the final Gallup poll had Eisenhower winning the popular vote 51–49 in a close contest.\n",
        "\n",
        "The prediction led CBS's news boss in New York, Siegfried Mickelson, to believe the computer was in error, and he refused to allow the prediction to be read. Instead, the crew showed some staged theatrics that suggested the computer was not responsive, and announced it was predicting 8–7 odds for an Eisenhower win (the actual prediction was 100–1 in his favour).\n",
        "\n",
        "When the predictions proved true—Eisenhower defeated Stevenson in a landslide, with UNIVAC coming within 3.5% of his popular vote total and four votes of his Electoral College total—Charles Collingwood, the on-air announcer, announced that they had failed to believe the earlier prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "The United States Army requested a UNIVAC computer from Congress in 1951. Colonel Wade Heavey explained to the Senate subcommittee that the national mobilization planning involved multiple industries and agencies: \"This is a tremendous calculating process...there are equations that can not be solved by hand or by electrically operated computing machines because they involve millions of relationships that would take a lifetime to figure out.\" Heavey told the subcommittee it was needed to help with mobilization and other issues similar to the invasion of Normandy that were based on the relationships of various groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "The UNIVAC was manufactured at Remington Rand's former Eckert-Mauchly Division plant on W Allegheny Avenue in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Remington Rand also had an engineering research lab in Norwalk, Connecticut, and later bought Engineering Research Associates (ERA) in St. Paul, Minnesota. In 1953 or 1954 Remington Rand merged their Norwalk tabulating machine division, the ERA \"scientific\" computer division, and the UNIVAC \"business\" computer division into a single division under the UNIVAC name. This severely annoyed those who had been with ERA and with the Norwalk laboratory.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 1955 Remington Rand merged with Sperry Corporation to become Sperry Rand. General Douglas MacArthur, then the chairman of the Board of Directors of Remington Rand, was chosen to continue in that role in the new company. Harry Franklin Vickers, then the President of Sperry Corporation, continued as president and CEO of Sperry Rand. The UNIVAC division of Remington Rand was renamed the Remington Rand Univac division of Sperry Rand. William Norris was put in charge as Vice-President and General Manager reporting to the President of the Remington Rand Division (of Sperry Rand).\n",

        "UNIVAC didn’t just build computers; it built the **foundation of modern computing**. From the first commercial mainframe to pioneering minicomputers, its innovations shaped the entire industry and made the concept of “software” and “programming” part of everyday language.

        "## **The History and Legacy of UNIVAC**\n",
        "\n",
        "**UNIVAC** (Universal Automatic Computer) stands as a monumental pillar in the history of computing, representing the transition from experimental, government-funded projects to the dawn of the commercial computer industry. Originally developed by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, the inventors of the ENIAC, UNIVAC was the first general-purpose electronic digital computer design for business and administrative use in the United States.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Origins and Early Struggles**\n",
        "The story of UNIVAC began in 1946 when Eckert and Mauchly left the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering following a patent dispute. They formed the **Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation (EMCC)** in Philadelphia. Their initial goal was to build a machine for the Bureau of the Census. However, financial difficulties plagued the young company. Following the tragic death of their chief financial backer, Henry L. Straus, in a plane crash in 1949, EMCC was sold to **Remington Rand** in 1950. This acquisition provided the necessary capital to bring their vision to life, with Eckert and Mauchly staying on to report to Leslie Groves, the retired general who had managed the Manhattan Project.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **The UNIVAC I and the 1952 Election**\n",
        "The first fruit of this labor was the **UNIVAC I**, delivered to the U.S. Census Bureau in 1951. It was a technological marvel of its time, utilizing mercury delay lines for memory and magnetic tape for data storage—a significant innovation over the punch cards used by competitors like IBM. The machine weighed approximately 13 tons and occupied over 35 square meters of floor space.\n",
        "\n",
        "UNIVAC gained legendary status during the **1952 U.S. Presidential Election**. CBS News used the computer to predict the outcome between Dwight D. Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson. With only a small sample of votes counted, UNIVAC predicted an Eisenhower landslide (100-to-1 odds), contradicting widespread polling that predicted a close race. CBS executives, fearing a humiliating error, refused to air the prediction initially. When the final results confirmed Eisenhower's massive victory—within 3.5% of UNIVAC's calculation—it cemented the computer's reputation for accuracy and introduced the public to the power of data processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Corporate Evolution**\n",
        "The brand's history is also one of complex corporate mergers. In 1955, Remington Rand merged with the Sperry Corporation to form **Sperry Rand**. The UNIVAC division continued to innovate, producing successors like the UNIVAC 1107 and 1108, which were used in NASA's Apollo missions. By the 1960s, UNIVAC was one of the few competitors to IBM, often referred to as part of \"the BUNCH\" (Burroughs, UNIVAC, NCR, Control Data, and Honeywell).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Legacy**\n",
        "The UNIVAC name eventually faded as the industry consolidated; Sperry merged with Burroughs in 1986 to form **Unisys**, which exists today. However, UNIVAC's legacy is undeniable. It was the first computer to handle both numerical and textual data effectively, making it suitable for business tasks like payroll and inventory, not just scientific calculation. For a generation, \"UNIVAC\" was synonymous with \"computer,\" setting the stage for the digital revolution that followed.\n",
