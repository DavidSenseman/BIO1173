    "In Keras, regression models can be built using deep neural networks to predict continuous values. The RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of regression models. It measures the average magnitude of the errors between predicted and actual values. To train a regression model using Keras, you would typically define a deep neural network architecture with dense layers, activation functions, and optimizer. The target variable would be continuous and the loss function used would be mean squared error (MSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the model would minimize the MSE loss function by adjusting the weights and biases of the neural network using backpropagation. The model's performance can be evaluated using RMSE on a separate test dataset, where a lower RMSE indicates a better performing model. Overall, Keras Regression for Deep Neural Networks with RMSE involves building a neural network for regression tasks, training it using MSE loss, and evaluating its performance using RMSE.\n",

It provides a single, interpretable metric for assessing the model's performance.\n",
