This helps solidify your understanding and enhances your problem-solving skills. By tackling these assignments independently, you develop critical thinking and the ability to synthesize information from various sources. Moreover, assignments encourage you to explore topics more deeply, fostering intellectual curiosity and promoting a deeper engagement with the subject matter. Ultimately, these assignments are not just a measure of your learning, but a means to equip you with the skills needed for real-world applications and future challenges."
