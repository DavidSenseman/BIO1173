    "# Part 4.2: Multiclass Classification with ROC and AUC\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of modern neural networks can be of many different forms. However, classically, neural network output has typically been one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Binary Classification** - Classification between two possibilities (positive and negative). Common in medical testing, does the person has the disease (positive) or not (negative).\n",
    "* **Classification** - Classification between more than 2 possibilites, for example the Iris dataset (3-way classification).\n",
    "* **Regression** - Numeric prediction.  How many MPG does a car get? (covered in next video)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at some visualizations for all three in this lesson. In particular, we will focus on the importance of evaluating **_false positives_** and **_false negatives_** in the results produced by a neural network. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Classification and ROC Charts\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary classification occurs when a neural network must choose between two options: true/false, yes/no, correct/incorrect, or healthy/diseased. To see how to use binary classification, we will consider a classification system for quantitative cytological measurements of cells extracted from female breast tumors. This system will to classify if a breast tumor is cancerous (malignant) or not (benign). This classification system must decide how to respond to a new patient presenting with a breast tumor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you have only two classes that you can consider, the objective function's score is the number of false-positive predictions versus the number of false negatives. False negatives and false positives are both types of errors, and it is essential to understand the difference. For breast cancer data example, diagnosing a breast tumor as cancerous (malignant) would be positive. A false positive occurs when the model decides the tumor is cancerous when in fact it is benign. A false negative happens when the model decides the tumor is benign when in fact it is cancerous. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because only two options exist, we can choose the mistake that is the more serious type of error, a false positive or a false negative. This depends entirely on the situation. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Breast Cancer Diagnosis\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of diagnosing breast cancer tumors, a false positive result is generally considered worse than a false negative result in the short-term, but not in the long-term.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **False positive result:** means that a patient is incorrectly told they have cancer when they do not. This can lead to unnecessary anxiety, invasive follow-up tests, and potentially harmful treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **False negative result:** means that a patient is incorrectly told they do not have cancer when they actually do. This may delay necessary treatment and allow the cancer to progress without intervention, potentially leading to poorer outcomes in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### COVID-19 Diagnosis\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, consider the situation where a model predicts whether a subject has COVID-19. In the context of diagnosing COVID-19, a false negative result is generally considered worse than a false positive result.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **False negative result:** means that a person is incorrectly told they do not have COVID-19 when they actually do. This can lead to the person unknowingly spreading the virus to others, potentially causing further infections and contributing to community transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **False positive result:** means that a person is incorrectly told they have COVID-19 when they do not. While this can lead to unnecessary isolation and anxiety for the individual, it typically does not have as severe consequences for public health as a false negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is not always clear which type of error is more important, it is obvious that having a solid understanding of how neural network models work, and how to assess their predictive accuracy is of paramount importance for their appropriate deployment in a clinical setting and how to explain a model's predictions to patients and their family members."

The curve allows for comparison of different models and helps in determining the optimal threshold for a given model. A higher area under the ROC curve indicates better performance of the model.\n",

    "Z-scores are a method of standardizing values by expressing them in terms of standard deviations from the mean. To calculate a z-score, you subtract the mean of the dataset from a specific value and then divide by the standard deviation. This normalization process allows for comparison of values across different datasets and variables, as it puts everything on a common scale.\n",

They can help identify outliers in a dataset, determine the relative position of a data point within a distribution, and assess the significance of a particular value compared to the overall dataset. Z-scores are commonly used in various fields such as statistics, finance, and psychology to compare and evaluate data in a meaningful way.\n",

    "\n",
    "ROC curve stands for \"Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve\". The ROC Curve above shows the performance of the classification model `piModel` at all classification thresholds for predicting whether a Pima women has Type II diabetes. \n",
    "\n",
    "This curve plots two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* True Positive Rate (Sensitivity)\n",
    "* False Positive Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "**True Positive Rate (TPR)** is a synonym for _sensitivity_ and is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$TPR=\\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the sensitivity of the model (True Positive Rate) increases to a perfect score (1.0) as the False Negative rate decreases to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**False Positive Rate (FPR)** is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$FPR=\\frac{FP}{FP+TN}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the False Positive Rate increases to a perfect score (1.0) as the True Negative rate decreases to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ROC curve plots TPR vs. FPR at different classification thresholds. Lowering the classification threshold classifies more items as positive, thus increasing both False Positives and True Positives. \n",
    "\n",
    "### AUC: Area Under the ROC Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC stands for \"Area under the ROC Curve.\" In the plot above, the area colored light blue is the AUC. AUC measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve (think integral calculus) from (0,0) to (1,1).\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds. One way of interpreting AUC is as the probability that the model ranks a random positive example more highly than a random negative example.\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC ranges in value from 0 to 1. A model whose predictions are 100% wrong has an AUC of 0.0; one whose predictions are 100% correct has an AUC of 1.0. In this example, the AUC of the model `piModel` was 0.80.\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC is desirable for the following two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* AUC is **scale-invariant**. It measures how well predictions are ranked, rather than their absolute values.\n",
    " \n",

    "### Analysis of the Confusion Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's analyze the Confusion Matrix above to see what is says about your Iris Flower model, `ifModel`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the Confusion Matrix your `ifModel` was able to predict, with 100% accuracy, the correct species of flowers obtained from both _`Iris setosa`_ (top left) and _`Iris virginica`_ (bottom right). The top left and bottom right squares in the Confusion Matrix are colored with the darkest possible shade of blue. According to the color key shown at the right of this image, this shade of dark blue represents a value of `1.0`, which means a perfect score.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it came to flowers from the species, _`Iris versicolor`_, however, your model was accurate only about 90% of the time. Furthermore, based on the Confusion Matrix, when your model made a mistake, it invariably classified an _`Iris versicolor`_ flower as being from the species _`Iris virginica`_, but it _never_ confused the flower as being from the species _`Iris setosa`_. (Note light blue color panel in the center of the right side). \n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to improve our model, we should focus on ways to improve the model's ability to discrimate between flowers from these two species.\n"
