We'll be working with the **Google Gemini API** and the **LangChain Google integration** to achieve this. Specifically, we'll demonstrate how to input normal text and have it spoken by the computer, and conversely, how we can speak to the computer and have it respond. We'll ultimately integrate these functionalities to create a chatbot that handles both text-to-speech and speech-to-text interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "While we'll use Google `Colab` for this demonstration, in production environments, you'd likely use a mobile app or a web-based JavaScript solution, as each platform handles voice differently. We'll focus on keeping things generic and simple in Colab for now.\n",

        "Voice applications are everywhere. For example, I can ask \"`Alexa`, what time is it?\" and multiple `Alexa` devices in my home will respond, although not always perfectly. I usually mute them during recording sessions. Applications like `Siri` or `Gemini` also offer voice interactions. For instance, you can now interact with the `Gemini` mobile app completely hands-free, or use the microphone input on the web interface.\n",

        "To illustrate, I asked `Gemini`, \"How are you doing?\" and it responded by offering some insightful thoughts about the rapid evolution of multimodal AI. It highlighted that models like Gemini aren't just processing text anymore—they are natively designed to understand text, images, and **audio** simultaneously. It also suggested that students experiment with these new \"multimodal\" capabilities, as building hands-on projects is one of the best ways to understand the future of AI."

We'll explore how these models can be integrated into applications to enable voice-based interactions, transcription services, and accessibility features.

        "This Python function records audio from the user's microphone, converts it to a WAV file, and saves it to the disk. It accomplishes this by generating a JavaScript snippet that runs within a browser environment (i.e. Colab Notebook using `output.eval_js`) to access the microphone, then converts the resulting audio blob to a base64 string, and passes it back to Python for processing. The Python part then decodes the base64 string, saves it as a `.webm` file, and uses `ffmpeg` to convert it to `.wav` format. If successful, it deletes the .webm file and returns the path to the `.wav` file.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it Works**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Audio Capture:** Uses JavaScript (navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia) to request microphone access and record audio for a specified number of seconds (default 3).\n",
        "2. **Data Conversion:** The recorded audio is converted into a base64 encoded string within the JavaScript environment and passed back to the Python environment.\n",
        "3. **File Saving & Conversion:** Python decodes the base64 string, saves it as a `.webm` file, and uses `ffmpeg` to transcode it to .wav format (16kHz, mono).\n",
        "4. **Cleanup:** It deletes the .webm file after successful conversion and returns the path to the .wav file. If any step fails, it returns None.\n",

        "3. **API Call:** It constructs a request to the Gemini API, including the user's prompt (e.g., \"Transcribe this audio...\") and the raw audio bytes with a MIME type of audio/wav.\n",
        "4. **Processing:** The API processes the audio and returns a text response.\n",

        "#####  **Overview of the API**\n",
        "- **Models**: We use **Gemini 2.5 Flash**. It is a \"multimodal\" model, meaning it can natively understand text, images, and **audio** simultaneously.\n",
        "- **Input**: Accepts audio data directly (e.g., WAV, MP3, MP4) alongside text prompts.\n",
        "- **Output**: Returns text, JSON, or structured data based on your instructions.\n",
        "- **Capabilities**: Unlike traditional \"transcription-only\" models, you can ask Gemini to do things *while* it listens, such as \"Summarize this recording,\" \"Extract the patient's symptoms,\" or \"Translate this to Spanish.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Why It's Useful for Biomedical Investigators**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Transcribing Interviews & Focus Groups**\n",
        "   Automatically convert recorded conversations with patients, clinicians, or research participants into text for qualitative analysis.\n",

        "4. **Data Extraction from Audio**\n",
        "   Enables downstream NLP tasks like identifying social determinants of health (SDOH) or extracting biomedical entities directly from spoken content without needing a separate transcription step.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Multilingual Support**\n",
        "   Useful in global health research where interviews or data collection occur in multiple languages.\n"

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Kore:** An energetic and youthful female voice with a bright, professional quality. Kore conveys high enthusiasm and confidence without being overly casual. This makes it an excellent choice for upbeat tutorials, engaging customer support, or any interaction where you want to keep the user’s energy high.\n",

        "    * It is looking **only** for the specific acoustic signature of the wake word (e.g., *\"Hey Google\"*).\n",
        "    * If the wake word is *not* detected, the audio is discarded immediately and never leaves the device.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Active Listening (Cloud Processing):**\n",
        "    * Once the wake word is detected, the device \"wakes up\" (often indicated by LEDs lighting up or a \"blip\" sound).\n",
        "    * It begins recording your actual command (e.g., *\"What is the weather?\"*).\n",

        "**\"Attention Is All You Need\"** is a 2017 landmark research paper in machine learning authored by eight scientists working at Google. The paper introduced a new deep learning architecture known as the transformer, based on the attention mechanism proposed in 2014 by Bahdanau et al. It is considered a foundational paper in modern artificial intelligence, as the transformer approach has become the main architecture of large language models like those based on GPT. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving Seq2seq techniques for machine translation, but the authors go further in the paper, foreseeing the technique's potential for other tasks like question answering and what is now known as multimodal Generative AI.\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper's title is a reference to the song \"All You Need Is Love\" by the Beatles. The name \"Transformer\" was picked because Jakob Uszkoreit, one of the paper's authors, liked the sound of that word.\n",

        "An early design document was titled \"Transformers: Iterative Self-Attention and Processing for Various Tasks\", and included an illustration of six characters from the Transformers animated show. The team was named Team Transformer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some early examples that the team tried their Transformer architecture on included English-to-German translation, generating Wikipedia articles on \"The Transformer\", and parsing. These convinced the team that the Transformer is a general purpose language model, and not just good for translation.\n",

All eight authors were \"equal contributors\" to the paper; the listed order was randomized. The Wired article highlights the group's diversity:\n",
        "\n",
        "Six of the eight authors were born outside the United States; the other two are children of two green-card-carrying Germans who were temporarily in California and a first-generation American whose family had fled persecution, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Methods Discussed & Introduced**\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper is most well known for the introduction of the Transformer architecture, which forms the underlying architecture for most forms of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). A key reason for why the architecture is preferred by most modern LLMs is the parallelizability of the architecture over its predecessors. This ensures that the operations necessary for training can be accelerated on a GPU allowing both faster training times and models of bigger sizes to be trained.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following mechanisms were introduced by the paper as part of the development of the transformer architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Scaled dot-product Attention & Self-attention**\n",
        "\n",
        "The use of the scaled dot-product attention and self-attention mechanism instead of an RNN or LSTM (which rely on recurrence instead) allow for better performance as described in the following paragraph.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the model relies on Query (Q), Key (K) and Value (V) matrices that come from the same source itself (i.e. the input sequence / context window), this eliminates the need for RNNs completely ensuring parallelizability for the architecture. This differs from the original form of the Attention mechanism introduced in 2014. Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of an additional scaling factor that was found to be most effective with respect to the dimension of the key vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the specific context of translation which the paper focused on, the Query and Key matrices are usually represented in embeddings corresponding to the source language while the Value matrix corresponds to the target language.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Multi-head Attention**\n",
        "\n",
        "In the self-attention mechanism, queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V) are dynamically generated for each input sequence (limited typically by the size of the context window), allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence at different steps. Multi-head attention enhances this process by introducing multiple parallel attention heads. Each attention head learns different linear projections of the Q, K, and V matrices. This allows the model to capture different aspects of the relationships between words in the sequence simultaneously, rather than focusing on a single aspect.\n",
        "\n",
        "By doing this, multi-head attention ensures that the input embeddings are updated from a more varied and diverse set of perspectives. After the attention outputs from all heads are calculated, they are concatenated and passed through a final linear transformation to generate the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Positional Encoding**\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the `Transformer model` is not a `seq2seq model` and does not rely on the sequence of the text in order to perform encoding and decoding, the paper relied on the use of sine and cosine wave functions to encode the position of the token into the embedding.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Historical context**\n",
        "\n",
        "For many years, sequence modelling and generation was done by using plain recurrent neural networks (RNNs). A well-cited early example was the Elman network (1990). In theory, the information from one token can propagate arbitrarily far down the sequence, but in practice the vanishing-gradient problem leaves the model's state at the end of a long sentence without precise, extractable information about preceding tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "A key breakthrough was LSTM (1995), a RNN which used various innovations to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, allowing efficient learning of long-sequence modelling. One key innovation was the use of an attention mechanism which used neurons that multiply the outputs of other neurons, so-called multiplicative units. Neural networks using multiplicative units were later called sigma-pi networks or higher-order networks. LSTM became the standard architecture for long sequence modelling until the 2017 publication of Transformers. However, LSTM still used sequential processing, like most other RNNs. Specifically, RNNs operate one token at a time from first to last; they cannot operate in parallel over all tokens in a sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Modern Transformers overcome this problem, but unlike RNNs, they require computation time that is quadratic in the size of the context window. The linearly scaling fast weight controller (1992) learns to compute a weight matrix for further processing depending on the input. One of its two networks has \"fast weights\" or \"dynamic links\" (1981). A slow neural network learns by gradient descent to generate keys and values for computing the weight changes of the fast neural network which computes answers to queries. This was later shown to be equivalent to the unnormalized linear Transformer.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Transformer Architecture**\n",
        "\n",
        "In the Transformer architecture, the self-attention mechanism processes an input sequence by creating a new representation for each token, enriched with context from all other tokens in the sequence. Unlike older recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that process words one by one, self-attention processes the entire sequence in parallel, making it highly efficient.\n",
        "The core idea is for each token to \"look\" at all other tokens to determine their relevance and then use that information to create a more informed, context-aware representation of itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The self-attention process**\n",

        "For a given input sequence, such as \"The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired,\" the self-attention process happens in the following stages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Create Query, Key, and Value vectors:** For every token in the sequence (e.g., \"it\"), the model creates three distinct vectors:\n",
        "* * **Query (Q):** Represents the current token, acting like a question used to find related tokens.\n",
        "* * **Key (K):** Represents the token being looked at, acting like a label for its information.\n",
        "* **Value (V):** Contains the content or contextual information of the token.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Calculate attention scores:** To determine how much focus \"it\" should place on other words, the model calculates a score for every other token in the sentence. This is done by taking the dot product of the current token's query vector with each of the other tokens' key vectors. A high dot-product score indicates a strong relationship between the two tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Scale the scores:** The scores are scaled by dividing them by the square root of the key vector's dimension. This prevents the scores from growing too large, which helps to stabilize training.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Normalize with Softmax:** The scaled scores are passed through a softmax function, which converts them into a probability distribution. This ensures that all the attention weights sum up to 1, making them easier to interpret.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Compute the weighted sum:** Each token's value vector is multiplied by its corresponding softmax score. The weighted value vectors are then summed to produce a new, context-rich output vector for the original token. In the sentence example, this process would give the word \"it\" a new representation that incorporates information from \"animal,\" correctly linking the two words.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Enhancing self-attention with multi-head attention**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Transformer architecture takes this mechanism one step further by using multi-head **attention**.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Instead of a single attention calculation, multi-head attention performs several self-attention calculations in parallel using different learned sets of Q, K, and V weight matrices.\n",
        "* Each \"head\" learns to focus on different types of relationships. For example, one head might attend to grammatical connections, while another might focus on semantic meaning.\n",
        "* The results from each head are then concatenated and passed through a final linear layer to produce the refined output. This gives the model a much richer, multi-contextual understanding of the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Preserving word order with positional encoding**\n",
        "\n",
        "Because the self-attention mechanism processes all tokens in parallel, it inherently loses information about word order. To address this, the Transformer injects positional information into the input embeddings using positional encoding. This is typically done with sinusoidal functions that create a unique vector for each position in the sequence, which is then added to the token's embedding. This process allows the model to capture the sequence's structure without sacrificing parallel processing efficiency."
