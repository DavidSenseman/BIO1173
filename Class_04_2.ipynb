To see how to use binary classification, we will consider a classification system for quantitative cytological measurements of cells extracted from female breast tumors.

False negatives and false positives are both types of errors, and it is essential to understand the difference. For breast cancer data example, diagnosing a breast tumor as cancerous (malignant) would be positive. A false positive occurs when the model decides the tumor is cancerous when in fact it is benign. A false negative happens when the model decides the tumor is benign when in fact it is cancerous.\n",

In general, increasing sensitivity tends to decrease specificity, and vice versa. This is because the parameters that contribute to sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) are often inversely related.\n",

        "* **Sensitivity** focuses on minimizing false negatives, which means it aims to correctly identirisY all individuals with the condition. To achieve high sensitivity, the test may be designed to detect even low levels of the condition, making it more likely to generate false positives (lower specificity).\n",

        "* **Specificity** aims to minimize false positives by correctly identirisYing individuals without the condition. To achieve high specificity, the test may be designed to only detect the presence of the condition with a high degree of certainty, potentially leading to missed detections of milder cases (lower sensitivity).\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, to maximize sensitivity, a test may detect even slight signals of the condition, increasing the likelihood of false positives and reducing specificity. Conversely, a test designed for high specificity may require stronger, more specific indicators of the condition, potentially missing milder cases and reducing sensitivity. Achieving a balance between sensitivity and specificity is crucial in developing effective diagnostic tests.\n"

The data file, `heart_disease.csv` is located on the course HTTPS server, located in the following filepath: `/BIO1173/data/`. The code below shows how to read this data file and store the information in a new DataFrame called `ecgDF`. We will generate a new DataFrame to prevent problems with the previous manipulations of this dataset.\n",

        "The code in the cell below starts by splitting the X-values stored in the X feature vector, `ecgX`, into `ecgX_train` and `ecgX_test` sets with 75% being used for training.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarily, the Y-values stores in `ecgY` are split into `ecgY_train` and `ecgY_test` sets. Keep in mind that the Y-values in the training and testing sets match the X-values in the training and testing sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "The cell below then builds a linear (\"sequential\") muticlass classsification neural network called `ecgModel` with 3 hidden layers. The number of inputs to the 1st hidden layer is specified by the argument `input_dim=ecgX.shape[1]`. Similarly, the argument `ecgY.shape[1]`, is used in the output layer to specirisY the number output neurons. Since there are 3 classes in `ecgY` (`LVH`, `Normal`, `ST`) the output layer will have 3 neurons--one neuron for each class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since this model is doing classification, we will compile it using the loss function, `categorical_crossentropy` with the `Adam` optimizer.\n",
        "\n",
        "To allow for early stopping, an EarlyStopping monitor, `ecgMoniter` is created.  The monitor is specified to wait `50` epochs for the validation loss to start improving after reaching a local minimum, before termining the training. This is a fairly long time to wait, but it is needed in this example due to the relatively low number of data samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the model `ecgModel` is trained (fitted) to the training and test (validation) data sets for 1000 epochs."

The variable y-hat is the neural network’s prediction, and the variable y is the known correct answer.  In this case, y will always be 0 or 1.  The training data have no probabilities. The neural network classifies it either into one class (1) or the other (0).  \n",

If the neural network had predicted 1.0 for class A, and the correct answer was A, your score would increase by log (1), which is 0.

        "\n",
        "A **Confusion Matrix** is a performance measurement tool used in machine learning for evaluating the accuracy of a classification model. It is a table that allows visualization of the performance of a model by comparing the actual values of the target variable with the predicted values. The confusion matrix is particularly useful for evaluating the performance of a classification model on a dataset with known class labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "The confusion matrix is organized into a grid with four possible outcomes:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **True Positives (TP):** The number of correct predictions that the model has made for the positive class.\n",
        "* **True Negatives (TN):** The number of correct predictions that the model has made for the negative class.\n",
        "* **False Positives (FP):** The number of incorrect predictions that the model has made, predicting a positive class when the actual class is negative (Type I error).\n",
        "* **False Negatives (FN):** The number of incorrect predictions that the model has made, predicting a negative class when the actual class is positive (Type II error).\n",
        "\n",
        "The confusion matrix enables the calculation of various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and specificity. These metrics help in assessing the model's performance, identirisYing potential areas for improvement, and making informed decisions about the model's effectiveness for the given classification task.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, a confusion matrix shows which predicted classes are often confused for the other classes. The vertical axis (y) represents the true labels and the horizontal axis (x) represents the predicted labels. When the true label and predicted label are the same, the highest values occur down the diagonal extending from the upper left to the lower right. The other values, outside the diagonal, represent incorrect predictions. For example, in the confusion matrix below, the value in row 2, column 1 shows how often the predicted value A occurred when it should have been B."

To generate the Confusion Matrix, only two arguments need to be passed to the plotting function, the actual values of the `RestingEGC` of the patients in the validation set (i.e. `ecgY_compare`), and the model's predicted values for these patients (i.e. `ecgPred`)."

        "**\"Attention Is All You Need\"** is a 2017 landmark research paper in machine learning authored by eight scientists working at Google. The paper introduced a new deep learning architecture known as the transformer, based on the attention mechanism proposed in 2014 by Bahdanau et al. It is considered a foundational paper in modern artificial intelligence, as the transformer approach has become the main architecture of large language models like those based on GPT. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving Seq2seq techniques for machine translation, but the authors go further in the paper, foreseeing the technique's potential for other tasks like question answering and what is now known as multimodal Generative AI.\n",

        "The paper is most well known for the introduction of the Transformer architecture, which forms the underlying architecture for most forms of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). A key reason for why the architecture is preferred by most modern LLMs is the parallelizability of the architecture over its predecessors. This ensures that the operations necessary for training can be accelerated on a GPU allowing both faster training times and models of bigger sizes to be trained.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following mechanisms were introduced by the paper as part of the development of the transformer architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Scaled dot-product attention & self-attention**\n",
        "\n",
        "The use of the scaled dot-product attention and self-attention mechanism instead of an RNN or LSTM (which rely on recurrence instead) allow for better performance as described in the following paragraph.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the model relies on Query (Q), Key (K) and Value (V) matrices that come from the same source itself (i.e. the input sequence / context window), this eliminates the need for RNNs completely ensuring parallelizability for the architecture. This differs from the original form of the Attention mechanism introduced in 2014. Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of an additional scaling factor that was found to be most effective with respect to the dimension of the key vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the specific context of translation which the paper focused on, the Query and Key matrices are usually represented in embeddings corresponding to the source language while the Value matrix corresponds to the target language.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Multi-head attention**\n",
        "\n",
        "In the self-attention mechanism, queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V) are dynamically generated for each input sequence (limited typically by the size of the context window), allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence at different steps. Multi-head attention enhances this process by introducing multiple parallel attention heads. Each attention head learns different linear projections of the Q, K, and V matrices. This allows the model to capture different aspects of the relationships between words in the sequence simultaneously, rather than focusing on a single aspect.\n",
        "\n",
        "By doing this, multi-head attention ensures that the input embeddings are updated from a more varied and diverse set of perspectives. After the attention outputs from all heads are calculated, they are concatenated and passed through a final linear transformation to generate the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Positional encoding**\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the Transformer model is not a seq2seq model and does not rely on the sequence of the text in order to perform encoding and decoding, the paper relied on the use of sine and cosine wave functions to encode the position of the token into the embedding.\n",
        "\n",
        "** Historical context**\n",
        "\n",
        "For many years, sequence modelling and generation was done by using plain recurrent neural networks (RNNs). A well-cited early example was the Elman network (1990). In theory, the information from one token can propagate arbitrarily far down the sequence, but in practice the vanishing-gradient problem leaves the model's state at the end of a long sentence without precise, extractable information about preceding tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "A key breakthrough was LSTM (1995), a RNN which used various innovations to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, allowing efficient learning of long-sequence modelling. One key innovation was the use of an attention mechanism which used neurons that multiply the outputs of other neurons, so-called multiplicative units. Neural networks using multiplicative units were later called sigma-pi networks or higher-order networks. LSTM became the standard architecture for long sequence modelling until the 2017 publication of Transformers. However, LSTM still used sequential processing, like most other RNNs. Specifically, RNNs operate one token at a time from first to last; they cannot operate in parallel over all tokens in a sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Modern Transformers overcome this problem, but unlike RNNs, they require computation time that is quadratic in the size of the context window. The linearly scaling fast weight controller (1992) learns to compute a weight matrix for further processing depending on the input. One of its two networks has \"fast weights\" or \"dynamic links\" (1981). A slow neural network learns by gradient descent to generate keys and values for computing the weight changes of the fast neural network which computes answers to queries. This was later shown to be equivalent to the unnormalized linear Transformer."
