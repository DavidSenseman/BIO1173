    "# Part 4.2: Multiclass Classification with ROC and AUC\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of modern neural networks can be of many different forms. However, classically, neural network output has typically been one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Binary Classification** - Classification between two possibilities (positive and negative). Common in medical testing, does the person has the disease (positive) or not (negative).\n",
    "* **Classification** - Classification between more than 2 possibilites, for example the Iris dataset (3-way classification).\n",
    "* **Regression** - Numeric prediction.  How many MPG does a car get? (covered in next video)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at some visualizations for all three in this lesson. In particular, we will focus on the importance of evaluating **_false positives_** and **_false negatives_** in the results produced by a neural network. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Classification and ROC Charts\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary classification occurs when a neural network must choose between two options: true/false, yes/no, correct/incorrect, or healthy/diseased. To see how to use binary classification, we will consider a classification system for quantitative cytological measurements of cells extracted from female breast tumors. This system will to classify if a breast tumor is cancerous (malignant) or not (benign). This classification system must decide how to respond to a new patient presenting with a breast tumor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you have only two classes that you can consider, the objective function's score is the number of false-positive predictions versus the number of false negatives. False negatives and false positives are both types of errors, and it is essential to understand the difference. For breast cancer data example, diagnosing a breast tumor as cancerous (malignant) would be positive. A false positive occurs when the model decides the tumor is cancerous when in fact it is benign. A false negative happens when the model decides the tumor is benign when in fact it is cancerous. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because only two options exist, we can choose the mistake that is the more serious type of error, a false positive or a false negative. This depends entirely on the situation. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Breast Cancer Diagnosis\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of diagnosing breast cancer tumors, a false positive result is generally considered worse than a false negative result in the short-term, but not in the long-term.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **False positive result:** means that a patient is incorrectly told they have cancer when they do not. This can lead to unnecessary anxiety, invasive follow-up tests, and potentially harmful treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **False negative result:** means that a patient is incorrectly told they do not have cancer when they actually do. This may delay necessary treatment and allow the cancer to progress without intervention, potentially leading to poorer outcomes in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### COVID-19 Diagnosis\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, consider the situation where a model predicts whether a subject has COVID-19. In the context of diagnosing COVID-19, a false negative result is generally considered worse than a false positive result.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **False negative result:** means that a person is incorrectly told they do not have COVID-19 when they actually do. This can lead to the person unknowingly spreading the virus to others, potentially causing further infections and contributing to community transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **False positive result:** means that a person is incorrectly told they have COVID-19 when they do not. While this can lead to unnecessary isolation and anxiety for the individual, it typically does not have as severe consequences for public health as a false negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is not always clear which type of error is more important, it is obvious that having a solid understanding of how neural network models work, and how to assess their predictive accuracy is of paramount importance for their appropriate deployment in a clinical setting and how to explain a model's predictions to patients and their family members."

    "## ROC Curves\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is a graphical representation of the performance of a classification model at different threshold settings. It plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1 - specificity) for different threshold values. The curve allows for comparison of different models and helps in determining the optimal threshold for a given model. A higher area under the ROC curve indicates better performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand how to interpret an ROC curve can be extremely important in medical testing where the result is often **_binary_**, (1) the patient has the disease, (2) the patient does _not_ have the disease. This diagnosis can lead to two types of errors, known as false positives and false negatives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **False Positive** - Your test (neural network) indicated that the patient had the disease; however, the patient did not.\n",
    "* **False Negative** - Your test (neural network) indicated that the patient did not have the disease; however, the patient did have the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "And there are two ways that your diagnosis can be correct:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **True Positive** - Your test (neural network) correctly identified that the patient had the disease.\n",
    "* **True Negative** - Your test (neural network) correctly identified that the patient did not have the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type of Error**\n",
    "![__](https://biologicslab.co/BIO1173/images/class_4_errors.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks classify in terms of the probability of it being positive. However, at what possibility do you give a positive result? Is the cutoff 50%? 90%? Where you set this cutoff is called the **_threshold_**. Anything above the cutoff is positive; anything below is negative. Setting this cutoff allows the model to be more sensitive or specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sensitivity** of a test refers to its ability to correctly identify individuals who have the condition or disease (true positive rate). A highly sensitive test will correctly identify all or most of the individuals with the condition, resulting in few false negative results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Specificity** of a test, on the other hand, refers to its ability to correctly identify individuals who do not have the condition or disease (true negative rate). A highly specific test will correctly identify all or most of the individuals without the condition, resulting in few false positive results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key point is this: \n",

    "**Why not simply make a great test that is both highly sensitve and highly specific?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A test _cannot_ be both highly sensitive and highly specific simultaneously due to inherent trade-offs in test characteristics. In general, increasing sensitivity tends to decrease specificity, and vice versa. This is because the parameters that contribute to sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) are often inversely related.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sensitivity** focuses on minimizing false negatives, which means it aims to correctly identify all individuals with the condition. To achieve high sensitivity, the test may be designed to detect even low levels of the condition, making it more likely to generate false positives (lower specificity).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Specificity** aims to minimize false positives by correctly identifying individuals without the condition. To achieve high specificity, the test may be designed to only detect the presence of the condition with a high degree of certainty, potentially leading to missed detections of milder cases (lower sensitivity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to maximize sensitivity, a test may detect even slight signals of the condition, increasing the likelihood of false positives and reducing specificity. Conversely, a test designed for high specificity may require stronger, more specific indicators of the condition, potentially missing milder cases and reducing sensitivity. Achieving a balance between sensitivity and specificity is crucial in developing effective diagnostic tests.\n"

    "### Example 2: Preprocess Data for Neural Network Training\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, we will have to pre-process the Pima data in the DataFrame `pidDF` before it can be used to train a neural network. All of the data in `pidDF` is numeric, so it won't be necessary to One-Hot encode any categorical variables (strings). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are rather large differences in magnitude between different categories. For example, the average (mean) `Glucose` value = 120.894531, while the mean for the category `DiabetesPedigree` is only 0.471876. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its not that neural networks can't work with large and small numerical values at the same time, it's just that they **train better** when all of the data is similar in size. This can be achieve using data **_standarization_**. In the cell below we use a very common technique for standarization, converting each number to it's Z-score value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We beging by making a list of columns that we want to include in our standarization. In this example, we want to use all of the columns, except the column `Outcome`. Here is the code chunk to do this:\n",
    "~~~text\n",
    "# Generate column list for preprocessing \n",
    "pidX_columns = pidDF.columns.drop('Outcome')\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we use the `for` loop to \"loop through\" each column in the column list, and convert the numerical values in that column to its z-score equivalent:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~text\n",
    "# Replace values with their Z-scores\n",
    "for col in pidX_columns:\n",
    "    pidDF[col] = zscore(pidDF[col])\n",
    "~~~\n",

Z-scores are commonly used in various fields such as statistics, finance, and psychology to compare and evaluate data in a meaningful way.\n",

    "## ROC Curves\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve_** is a graphical representation that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classification system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The ROC curve plots the true positive rate (Sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1-Specificity) for various threshold values, showing the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curve is important in evaluating the performance of diagnostic tests or classification models as it provides a comprehensive assessment of their ability to discriminate between positive and negative cases. Some key reasons why ROC curves are important include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Quantitative Measure:** ROC curves provide a quantitative measure of the diagnostic accuracy of a test by summarizing its performance across all possible thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Comparison:** ROC curves allow for a direct comparison of different tests or models based on their area under the curve (AUC), where a higher AUC indicates better overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Threshold Selection:** ROC curves help in selecting the optimal threshold for classification that balances sensitivity and specificity based on the specific requirements of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Visual Representation:** The visual nature of ROC curves facilitates a clear understanding of the trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, aiding in decision-making and interpretation of test results.\n",

    "### ROC Curve: Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "ROC curve stands for \"Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve\". The ROC Curve above shows the performance of the classification model `piModel` at all classification thresholds for predicting whether a Pima women has Type II diabetes. \n",
    "\n",
    "This curve plots two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* True Positive Rate (Sensitivity)\n",
    "* False Positive Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "**True Positive Rate (TPR)** is a synonym for _sensitivity_ and is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$TPR=\\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the sensitivity of the model (True Positive Rate) increases to a perfect score (1.0) as the False Negative rate decreases to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**False Positive Rate (FPR)** is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$FPR=\\frac{FP}{FP+TN}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the False Positive Rate increases to a perfect score (1.0) as the True Negative rate decreases to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ROC curve plots TPR vs. FPR at different classification thresholds. Lowering the classification threshold classifies more items as positive, thus increasing both False Positives and True Positives. \n",
    "\n",
    "### AUC: Area Under the ROC Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC stands for \"Area under the ROC Curve.\" In the plot above, the area colored light blue is the AUC. AUC measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve (think integral calculus) from (0,0) to (1,1).\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds. One way of interpreting AUC is as the probability that the model ranks a random positive example more highly than a random negative example.\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC ranges in value from 0 to 1. A model whose predictions are 100% wrong has an AUC of 0.0; one whose predictions are 100% correct has an AUC of 1.0. In this example, the AUC of the model `piModel` was 0.80.\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC is desirable for the following two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* AUC is **scale-invariant**. It measures how well predictions are ranked, rather than their absolute values.\n",
    " \n",
    "* AUC is **classification-threshold-invariant**. It measures the quality of the model's predictions irrespective of what classification threshold is chosen."

The variable y-hat is the neural network’s prediction, and the variable y is the known correct answer.  In this case, y will always be 0 or 1.  The training data have no probabilities. The neural network classifies it either into one class (1) or the other (0).  \n",

    "The variable N represents the number of elements in the training set the number of questions in the test.  We divide by N because this process is customary for an average.  We also begin the equation with a negative because the log function is always negative over the domain 0 to 1.  This negation allows a positive score for the training to minimize.\n",

    "You will notice two terms are separated by the addition (+).  Each contains a log function.  Because y will be either 0 or 1, then one of these two terms will cancel out to 0.  If y is 0, then the first term will reduce to 0.  If y is 1, then the second term will be 0.  \n",

Essentially, if your prediction for class A is 70% (0.7), then your prediction for class B is 30% (0.3).  Your score will increase by the log of your prediction for the correct class.  If the neural network had predicted 1.0 for class A, and the correct answer was A, your score would increase by log (1), which is 0. For log loss, we seek a low score, so a correct answer results in 0.  Some of these log values for a neural network's probability estimate for the correct class:\n",

Of course, the above log values are for a single training set element.  We will average the log values for the entire training set.\n",

    "A confusion matrix is a performance measurement tool used in machine learning for evaluating the accuracy of a classification model. It is a table that allows visualization of the performance of a model by comparing the actual values of the target variable with the predicted values. The confusion matrix is particularly useful for evaluating the performance of a classification model on a dataset with known class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The confusion matrix is organized into a grid with four possible outcomes:\n",
    "\n",

    "The confusion matrix enables the calculation of various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and specificity. These metrics help in assessing the model's performance, identifying potential areas for improvement, and making informed decisions about the model's effectiveness for the given classification task.\n",

    "In other words, a confusion matrix shows which predicted classes are often confused for the other classes. The vertical axis (y) represents the true labels and the horizontal axis (x) represents the predicted labels. When the true label and predicted label are the same, the highest values occur down the diagonal extending from the upper left to the lower right. The other values, outside the diagonal, represent incorrect predictions. For example, in the confusion matrix below, the value in row 2, column 1 shows how often the predicted value A occurred when it should have been B."

To generate the Confusion Matrix, only two arguments need to be passed to the plotting function, the actual values of the `RestingEGC` of the patients in the validation set (i.e. `ecgY_compare`), and the model's predicted values for these patients (i.e. `ecgPred`).
