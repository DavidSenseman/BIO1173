        "\n",
        "A common problem that can occur during traing a neural network is called **_overfitting_**. Overfitting occurs when a neural network learns the training data too well.\n",
        "\n",
        "At first glance, it might seem strange that learning something \"too well\" would be bad. However, imagine a neural network trying to learn the difference between apples and oranges based on their color. If you have a neural network with too many parameters and you show it a training set where all the red fruits are apples and all the orange fruits are oranges, the network may learn to categorize fruits solely based on color.\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem comes when you show your trained neural network a new, unseen red fruit that is actually an orange. Your network may struggle to correctly classify it because its learning was too focused on the color feature during training. This would be an example of overfitting, where the network learned the training data too well at the expense of generalizing to new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In technical terms, overfitting occurs when a neural network starts to memorize noise and outliers in the data rather than generalizing patterns. This can lead to poor performance on new, unseen data because the network is too specialized to that specific training set. Overfitting is more likely to occur when you build a \"fancy\" neural network with a lot of parameters (e.g. many hidden layers with many neurons) and then train it on a relatively small dataset for far too many epochs. Overall, training a small network on a lot of data promotes better generalization, computational efficiency, robustness, and scalability compared to training a large network on a small amount of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lesson we look at a group of techniques that can reduce overfitting by promoting something called _regularization_."

        "\n",
        "Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a **_penalty term_** to the loss function. The goal of regularization is to discourage the model from becoming too complex and instead promote simpler and more generalizable models. There are two common types of regularization used in neural networks:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **L1 Regularization (Lasso):** In L1 regularization, the penalty term added to the loss function is the sum of the absolute values of the weights (L1 norm). This encourages sparsity in the weights, effectively reducing the number of parameters and promoting a simpler model.\n",
        "* **L2 Regularization (Ridge):** In L2 regularization, the penalty term added to the loss function is the sum of the squares of the weights (L2 norm). This encourages smaller weights overall, effectively smoothing out the model and preventing large weight values that can lead to overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Humans are capable of overfitting as well. Human programmers often take certification exams to show their competence in a given programming language. To help prepare for these exams, the test makers often make practice exams available. Consider a programmer who enters a loop of taking the practice exam, studying more, and then retaking the practice exam. The programmer has **_memorized_** much of the practice exam at some point rather than learning the techniques necessary to figure out the individual questions. The programmer has now overfitted for the practice exam. When this programmer takes the real exam, his actual score will likely be lower than what he earned on the practice exam.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although a neural network received a high score on its training data, this result does not mean that the same neural network will score high on data that was not inside the training set. A computer can overfit as well. Regularization is one of the techniques that can prevent overfitting. Several different regularization techniques exist. Most work by analyzing and potentially modifying the weights of a neural network as it trains.  "

These algorithms can either work with an objective function or as part of the backpropagation algorithm. The regularization algorithm is attached to the training algorithm by adding an objective in both cases.  \n",

Both L1 and L2 calculate this penalty differently. You can add this penalty calculation to the calculated gradients for gradient-descent-based algorithms, such as backpropagation. The penalty is negatively combined with the objective score for objective-function-based training, such as simulated annealing.\n",

        "\n",
        "In this lesson we looked at 3 different ways to reduce overfitting when building neural networks:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **L1 (Lasso):** Lasso stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. It is frequently used in machine learning to handle high dimensional data as it facilitates automatic feature selection with its application. This penalty promotes sparsity within the model, which can help avoid issues of multicollinearity and overfitting issues within datasets.\n",
        "* **L2 (Ridge):** Ridge regression specifically corrects for multicollinearity in regression analysis. This is useful when developing machine learning models that have a large number of parameters, particularly if those parameters also have high weights.\n",
        "* **ElasticNet:** The elastic net method overcomes the limitations of the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) method. Also if there is a group of highly correlated variables, then the LASSO tends to select one variable from a group and ignore the others. To overcome these limitations, the elastic net adds a quadratic part to the penalty, which when used alone is ridge regression (known also as Tikhonov regularization).\n",
        "\n",
        "These regularization techniques were originally developed for linear regression using discrete mathematics as a way to avoid the problem of [multicollinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity).\n",
        "\n",
        "Multicollinearity refers to a situation where the predictive variables have a nearly exact linear relationship. Multicollinearity is a problem for linear regression analysis because it can cause several issues with the model interpretation and estimation of coefficients.\n",
        "* **Inflated Standard Errors:** Multicollinearity leads to high correlations between predictor variables, which can result in inflated standard errors of the regression coefficients. This makes it difficult to determine the true significance of the predictors in the model.\n",
        "* **Unstable Coefficients:** Multicollinearity can cause instability in the estimated coefficients, making them sensitive to small changes in the data. This makes it challenging to interpret the individual effects of each predictor on the target variable.\n",
        "* **Difficulty in Feature Selection:** Multicollinearity makes it hard to distinguish between the relative importance of correlated predictors. It can lead to difficulties in identifying which predictors are truly contributing to the model and which ones are redundant.\n",
        "* **Decreased Predictive Accuracy:** Multicollinearity can reduce the predictive accuracy of the model as it introduces noise and biases in the estimation process. This may result in a less reliable model for making predictions on new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, multicollinearity complicates the interpretation of the model, reduces the precision of coefficient estimates, and hinders the predictive performance of a linear regression model.\n",
        "\n",
        "It turns out the solutions for reducing multicollinearity in mathematical regression equations are also useful for preventing overfitting in neural network models.\n"

        "**Nvidia Corporation** (/ɛnˈvɪdiə/ en-VID-ee-ə) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, and incorporated in Delaware. Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang (president and CEO), Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, it is a software company which designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs) for data science and high-performance computing, and system on a chip units (SoCs) for mobile computing and the automotive market. Nvidia is also the dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software. Nvidia outsources the manufacturing of the hardware it designs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nvidia's professional line of GPUs are used for edge-to-cloud computing and in supercomputers and workstations for applications in fields such as architecture, engineering and construction, media and entertainment, automotive, scientific research, and manufacturing design. Its GeForce line of GPUs are aimed at the consumer market and are used in applications such as video editing, 3D rendering, and PC gaming. With a market share of 80.2% in the second quarter of 2023, Nvidia leads the market for discrete desktop GPUs by a wide margin. The company expanded its presence in the gaming industry with the introduction of the Shield Portable (a handheld game console), Shield Tablet (a gaming tablet), and Shield TV (a digital media player), as well as its cloud gaming service GeForce Now.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to GPU design and outsourcing manufacturing, Nvidia provides the CUDA software platform and API that allows the creation of massively parallel programs which utilize GPUs. They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world. In the late 2000s, Nvidia had moved into the mobile computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets and vehicle navigation and entertainment systems. Its competitors include AMD, Intel,[19] Qualcomm, and AI accelerator companies such as Cerebras and Graphcore. It also makes AI-powered software for audio and video processing (e.g., Nvidia Maxine).\n",
        "\n",
        "Nvidia's offer to acquire Arm from SoftBank in September 2020 failed to materialize following extended regulatory scrutiny, leading to the termination of the deal in February 2022 in what would have been the largest semiconductor acquisition. In 2023, Nvidia became the seventh public U.S. company to be valued at over \\$1 trillion, and the company's valuation has increased rapidly since then as the company became a leader in data center chips with AI capabilities in the midst of the AI boom. In June 2024, for one day, Nvidia overtook Microsoft as the world's most valuable publicly traded company, with a market capitalization of over \\$3.3 trillion.\n",

        "## **History**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Founding**\n",
        "\n",
        "Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang (who, as of 2024, remains CEO), a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems. The three men agreed to start the company in a meeting at a Denny's roadside diner on Berryessa Road in East San Jose.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the time, Malachowsky and Priem were frustrated with Sun's management and were looking to leave, but Huang was on \"firmer ground\", in that he was already running his own division at LSI. The three co-founders discussed a vision of the future which was so compelling that Huang decided to leave LSI and become the chief executive officer of their new startup.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 1993, the three co-founders envisioned that the ideal trajectory for the forthcoming wave of computing would be in the realm of accelerated computing, specifically in graphics-based processing. This path was chosen due to its unique ability to tackle challenges that eluded general-purpose computing methods.[36] As Huang later explained: \"We also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume. Those two conditions don’t happen very often. Video games was our killer app — a flywheel to reach large markets funding huge R&D to solve massive computational problems.\" With \\$40,000 in the bank, the company was born. The company subsequently received \\$20 million of venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital, Sutter Hill Ventures and others.\n",
        "\n",
        "During the late 1990s, Nvidia was one of 70 startup companies chasing the idea that graphics acceleration for video games was the path to the future. Only two survived: Nvidia and ATI Technologies, the latter of which merged into AMD.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nvidia initially had no name and the co-founders named all their files NV, as in \"next version\". The need to incorporate the company prompted the co-founders to review all words with those two letters. At one point, Malachowsky and Priem wanted to call the company NVision, but that name was already taken by a manufacturer of toilet paper. Huang suggested the name Nvidia, from \"invidia\", the Latin word for \"envy\". The company's original headquarters office was in Sunnyvale, California.\n",
        "\n",
        "**First graphics accelerator**\n",
        "\n",
        "Nvidia's first graphics accelerator, the NV1, was designed to process quadrilateral primitives (forward texture mapping), a feature that set it apart from competitors, who preferred triangle primitives. However, when Microsoft introduced the DirectX platform, it chose not to support any other graphics software and announced that its Direct3D API would exclusively support triangles. As a result, the NV1 failed to gain traction in the market.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nvidia had also entered into a partnership with Sega to supply the graphics chip for the Dreamcast console and worked on the project for about a year. However, Nvidia's technology was already lagging behind competitors. This placed the company in a difficult position: continue working on a chip that was likely doomed to fail or abandon the project, risking financial collapse.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a pivotal moment, Sega's president, Shoichiro Irimajiri, visited Huang in person to inform him that Sega had decided to choose another vendor for the Dreamcast. However, Irimajiri believed in Nvidia's potential and persuaded Sega’s management to invest $5 million into the company. Huang later reflected that this funding was all that kept Nvidia afloat, and that Irimajiri's \"understanding and generosity gave us six months to live\".\n",
        "\n",
        "In 1996, Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia's employees—thereby reducing headcount from 100 to 40—and focused the company's remaining resources on developing a graphics accelerator product optimized for processing triangle primitives: the RIVA 128. By the time the RIVA 128 was released in August 1997, Nvidia had only enough money left for one month’s payroll. The sense of impending failure became so pervasive that it gave rise to Nvidia's unofficial company motto: \"Our company is thirty days from going out of business.\" Huang began internal presentations to Nvidia staff with those words for many years.\n",

        "Nvidia sold about a million RIVA 128 units within four months, and used the revenue to fund development of its next generation of products. In 1998, the release of the RIVA TNT helped solidify Nvidia’s reputation as a leader in graphics technology.\n",

        "Nvidia went public on January 22, 1999. Investing in Nvidia after it had already failed to deliver on its contract turned out to be Irimajiri's best decision as Sega's president. After Irimajiri left Sega in 2000, Sega sold its Nvidia stock for \\$15 million.\n",

        "In late 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256 (NV10), its first product expressly marketed as a GPU, which was most notable for introducing onboard transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four-pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin.\n",

        "Due to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft's Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a \\$200 million advance. However, the project took many of its best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the GeForce2 GTS shipped in the summer of 2000. In December 2000, Nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its one-time rival 3dfx, a pioneer in consumer 3D graphics technology leading the field from the mid-1990s until 2000. The acquisition process was finalized in April 2002.\n",

        "In July 2002, Nvidia acquired Exluna for an undisclosed sum. Exluna made software-rendering tools and the personnel were merged into the Cg project. In August 2003, Nvidia acquired MediaQ for approximately US$70 million. It launched GoForce the follow year. On April 22, 2004, Nvidia acquired iReady, also a provider of high-performance TCP offload engines and iSCSI controllers. In December 2004, it was announced that Nvidia would assist Sony with the design of the graphics processor (RSX) for the PlayStation 3 game console. On December 14, 2005, Nvidia acquired ULI Electronics, which at the time supplied third-party southbridge parts for chipsets to ATI, Nvidia's competitor. In March 2006, Nvidia acquired Hybrid Graphics. In December 2006, Nvidia, along with its main rival in the graphics industry AMD (which had acquired ATI), received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry"
