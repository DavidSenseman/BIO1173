Fukushima  (1980) [[Cite:fukushima1980neocognitron]](https://www.rctn.org/bruno/public/papers/Fukushima1980.pdf) introduced the original concept of a convolutional neural network, and   LeCun, Bottou, Bengio & Haffner (1998) [[Cite:lecun1995convolutional]](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-bengio-95a.pdf) greatly improved this work.\n",

Although computer vision primarily uses CNNs, this technology has some applications outside of the field. You need to realize that if you want to utilize CNNs on non-visual data, you must find a way to encode your data to mimic the properties of visual data.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The order of the input array elements is _crucial_ to the training. In contrast, most neural networks that are not CNNs, treat their input data as a long vector of values. The order in which you arrange the incoming features in this vector is irrelevant. Importantly, you can't change the order of the data in these vectors for these types of neural networks once your network has been trained.\n",

        "On the other hand, the CNN network arranges the inputs into a **grid**. This arrangement works well with images because the pixels in closer proximity to each other are important to each other. The order of pixels in an image is significant. The human body is a relevant example of this type of order. For the design of the face, we are accustomed to eyes being near to each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "This advance in CNNs is due to years of research on biological eyes. In other words, CNNs utilize overlapping fields of input to simulate features of biological eyes. Until this breakthrough, AI had been unable to reproduce the capabilities of biological vision.\n",

        "Training takes the greatest amount of time and computer power. Unlike higher-level frameworks that use a single line (like `model.fit`), **PyTorch** requires us to write an explicit loop to iterate through the data. The code in the cell below trains the neural network model on the training data (`eg_train_loader`) and monitors its performance using the validation data (`eg_val_loader`).\n",

The code in the cell below is set to train the neural network for a maximum of 100 epochs. This is an upper limit since the training includes an _early stopping monitor_ to stop training if overfitting is detected.\n",

        "\n",
        "* **The DataLoaders (`eg_train_loader`):** Instead of calculating `steps_per_epoch` manually, PyTorch uses DataLoaders. These automatically divide your data into batches of size `BATCH_SIZE` and feed them to the model one by one.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The Training Phase (`eg_model.train()`):**\n",
        "    * **`optimizer.zero_grad()`**: Clears old gradients from the previous step.\n",
        "    * **`loss.backward()`**: Calculates the gradients (how much to change each weight) via backpropagation.\n",
        "    * **`optimizer.step()`**: Updates the model weights to minimize the loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The Validation Phase (`eg_model.eval()`):**\n",
        "    * We use `torch.no_grad()` to turn off gradient calculation. This saves memory and speed since we aren't training the model here, just testing it.\n",
        "    * We calculate the loss on the validation set to check if the model is learning general patterns or just memorizing the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Early Stopping:**\n",
        "    * At the end of every epoch, we call the `eg_early_stopping` class we created in Step 8.\n",
        "    * It compares the current validation loss to the best loss seen so far. If the model stops improving for `PATIENCE` (10) epochs, it triggers the break command to stop the loop.\n",

However, even with a paid subscription, there are limits on how much time you can use any of the GPUs. So you shouldn't automatically change to a runtime with a GPU unless there is a compelling reason to do so. Unfortunately, you can't change from a simple CPU to a GPU runtime right before you train your CNN; you must select it at the start of your session."

While newer languages have emerged, FORTRAN remains a testament to the enduring value of well-designed computational tools.\n",

        "**Fortran** (/ˈfɔːrtræn/; formerly FORTRAN) is a third generation, compiled, imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fortran was originally developed by IBM. It first compiled correctly in 1958. Fortran computer programs have been written to support scientific and engineering applications, such as numerical weather prediction, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, plasma physics, geophysics, computational physics, crystallography and computational chemistry. It is a popular language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers.\n",

        "Fortran has evolved through numerous versions and dialects. In 1966, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) developed a standard for Fortran to limit proliferation of compilers using slightly different syntax. Successive versions have added support for a character data type (Fortran 77), structured programming, array programming, modular programming, generic programming (Fortran 90), parallel computing (Fortran 95), object-oriented programming (Fortran 2003), and concurrent programming (Fortran 2008).\n",

        "Early IBM computers did not support lowercase letters, and the names of versions of the language through FORTRAN 77 were usually spelled in all-uppercase. FORTRAN 77 was the last version in which the Fortran character set included only uppercase letters.\n",

        "\n",
        "In late 1953, John W. Backus submitted a proposal to his superiors at IBM to develop a more practical alternative to assembly language for programming their IBM 704 mainframe computer. Backus' historic FORTRAN team consisted of programmers Richard Goldberg, Sheldon F. Best, Harlan Herrick, Peter Sheridan, Roy Nutt, Robert Nelson, Irving Ziller, Harold Stern, Lois Haibt, and David Sayre. Its concepts included easier entry of equations into a computer, an idea developed by J. Halcombe Laning and demonstrated in the Laning and Zierler system of 1952.\n",

        "A draft specification for The IBM Mathematical Formula Translating System was completed by November 1954. The first manual for FORTRAN appeared in October 1956, with the first FORTRAN compiler delivered in April 1957. Fortran produced efficient enough code for assembly language programmers to accept a high-level programming language replacement.\n",
        "\n",
        "John Backus said during a 1979 interview with Think, the IBM employee magazine, \"Much of my work has come from being lazy. I didn't like writing programs, and so, when I was working on the IBM 701, writing programs for computing missile trajectories, I started work on a programming system to make it easier to write programs.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The language was widely adopted by scientists for writing numerically intensive programs, which encouraged compiler writers to produce compilers that could generate faster and more efficient code. The inclusion of a complex number data type in the language made Fortran especially suited to technical applications such as electrical engineering.\n",
        "\n",
        "By 1960, versions of FORTRAN were available for the IBM 709, 650, 1620, and 7090 computers. Significantly, the increasing popularity of FORTRAN spurred competing computer manufacturers to provide FORTRAN compilers for their machines, so that by 1963 over 40 FORTRAN compilers existed.\n",
        "\n",
        "FORTRAN was provided for the IBM 1401 computer by an innovative 63-phase compiler that ran entirely in its core memory of only 8000 (six-bit) characters. The compiler could be run from tape, or from a 2200-card deck; it used no further tape or disk storage. It kept the program in memory and loaded overlays that gradually transformed it, in place, into executable form, as described by Haines. This article was reprinted, edited, in both editions of Anatomy of a Compiler and in the IBM manual \"Fortran Specifications and Operating Procedures, IBM 1401\". The executable form was not entirely machine language; rather, floating-point arithmetic, sub-scripting, input/output, and function references were interpreted, preceding UCSD Pascal P-code by two decades. GOTRAN, a simplified, interpreted version of FORTRAN I (with only 12 statements not 32) for \"load and go\" operation was available (at least for the early IBM 1620 computer). Modern Fortran, and almost all later versions, are fully compiled, as done for other high-performance languages.\n",
