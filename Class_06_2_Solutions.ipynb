        "If the code is correct you should see something _similar_ to the following output\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Interpretation**\n",
        "\n",
        "The confusion plot shows that your ONNX‐converted model reproduces the original Keras model’s predictions almost exactly. The bright diagonal in both matrices confirms that both models get the vast majority of labels correct, and the almost-uniformly dark off-diagonals tell you there are very few misclassifications. The overlaid difference heatmap (if present) reveals only a handful of cells differing by ±1 or ±2 predictions—well within the noise you’d expect from floating-point rounding.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **What the Diagonals Tell You**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Each cell on the diagonal represents “true class X predicted as X.”\n",
        "\n",
        "* Both Keras and ONNX show high counts here, indicating strong per-class accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "* No entire row or column dramatically degrades when you switch runtimes, so no class has suddenly become “invisible” to inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **What the Off-Diagonals Reveal**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Off-diagonal entries are where misclassifications live.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Sparse, low-value cells in both matrices confirm that the error patterns are essentially identical.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Any small red/blue tint in the difference plot signals ±1–2 sample swaps between classes (e.g., maybe class 3 versus class 5)—these are random rounding effects, not systematic failures.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Key Takeaways**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Conversion Fidelity:**\n",
        "The ONNX export preserved the decision boundaries. There’s no systemic bias introduced by the conversion.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Numerical Drift:**\n",
        "Tiny count shifts stem from backend differences in floating-point implementations (Softmax, logits ordering, etc.). They’re negligible for production.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Action Items**\n",
        "\n",
        "* If you need bit-perfect parity, consider aligning the Keras and ONNX runtimes’ epsilon or Softmax parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Run a full classification report (precision, recall, F1) on both to quantify any micro-differences."
