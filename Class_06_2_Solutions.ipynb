        "    * The code output confirms: `Do the confusion matrices match exactly? Yes`.\n",
        "    * Visually, the **PyTorch matrix (Blue)** and **ONNX matrix (Green)** are identical. This proves the ONNX model reproduces the PyTorch model's behavior across the entire dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Model Behavior (The \"Odd\" News):**\n",
        "    * You will notice **all predictions fall into \"Class 0\"** (the first column). The model predicted Class 0 for every single test sample (blue), and never predicted Classes 1-4 (green).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Why is the Model Only Predicting Class 0?**\n",
        "\n",
        "This \"Class 0 collapse\" is likely due to two compounding factors:\n",
        "* **Training Data Imbalance:** a majority of your original training images were from Class 0. This causes the model to learn a strong **prior bias**—it learns that \"when in doubt, guess Class 0\" is the statistically safest bet.\n",
        "* **Random Input Data:** Since we are testing with generated noise (`np.random.randn`) rather than real images, the model detects no recognizable features for any class. Lacking evidence, it reverts to its learned bias (Class 0).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion**\n",
        "We have **successfully converted the model.** Even though the predictions themselves are skewed due to data imbalance and random inputs, the **ONNX model is failing in _exactly_ the same way as the PyTorch model**, which is the definition of a successful conversion. In other words, **our PyTorch model is _not_ very good at classifying retinal fundus images into diabetic retinoptic categories**."

        "\n",
        "Besides accuracy, one would like to know if one model type runs \"faster\" than another. In other words, if we train a PyTorch model using Nvidia GPU hardware acceleration, does the ONNX version of the model run significatly faster (or slower)? Using a trained model to provide predictions is called **inference**. When you ask `ChatGPT` a question, the answer is an example of `inference` so it's important that a model can \"run fast\".\n",

        "The reason the PyTorch models runs 10X faster is due to hardware acceleration. In the code above, the PyTorch model was running on an **Nvidia GPU (T4)** while the **ONNX Runtime** defaulted to the **CPU** because we didn't configured a specific hardware driver (Execution Provider).\n",
