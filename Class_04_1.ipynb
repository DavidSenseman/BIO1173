        "\n",
        "**Large Language Models (LLMs)** such as `GPT` have brought AI into mainstream use. LLMs allow regular users to interact with AI using natural language. Most of these language models require extreme processing capabilities and hardware. Because of this, application programming interfaces (APIs) accessed through the Internet are becoming common entry points for these models. One of the most compelling features of services like ChatGPT is their availability as an API. But before we dive into the depths of coding and integration, let's understand what an API is and its significance in the AI domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "API stands for **Application Programming Interface**. Think of it as a bridge or a messenger that allows two different software applications to communicate. In the context of AI and machine learning, APIs often allow developers to access a particular model or service without having to house the model on their local machine. This technique can be beneficial when the model in question, like `ChatGPT`, is large and resource-intensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the realm of AI, APIs have several distinct advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1 Scalability:** Since the actual model runs on external servers, developers don't need to worry about scaling infrastructure.  \n",
        "**2. Maintenance:** You get to use the latest and greatest version of the model without constantly updating your local copy.  \n",
        "**3. Cost-Effective:** Leveraging external computational resources can be more cost-effective than maintaining high-end infrastructure locally, especially for sporadic or one-off tasks.  \n",
        "**4 Ease of Use:** Instead of diving into the nitty-gritty details of model implementation and optimization, developers can directly utilize its capabilities with a few lines of code.  \n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, we won't be running the neural network computations locally. We will use our PyTorch code to communicate with the `OpenAI API` to access and harness the abilities of `ChatGPT`. The actual execution of the neural network code happens on `OpenAI servers`, bringing forth a unique synergy of PyTorch's flexibility and ChatGPT's conversational mastery. (NOTE: The physical location of these servers is not disclosed for security reasons).\n",

        "\n",
        "As we delve deeper into the intricacies of deep learning, it's crucial to understand that the tools and platforms we use are as versatile as the concepts themselves. When it comes to accessing ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art conversational AI model developed by OpenAI, there are two predominant pathways:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Direct API Access using Python's HTTP Capabilities:** Python, with its rich library ecosystem, provides utilities like requests to directly communicate with APIs over HTTP. This method involves crafting the necessary API calls, handling responses, and error checking, giving the developer a granular control over the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Using the Official OpenAI Python Library:** OpenAI offers an official Python library, aptly named openai, that simplifies the process of integrating with ChatGPT and other OpenAI services. This library abstracts many of the intricacies and boilerplate steps of direct API access, offering a streamlined and user-friendly approach to interacting with the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each approach has its advantages. `Direct API access` provides a more hands-on, granular approach, allowing developers to intimately understand the intricacies of each API call. On the other hand, using the `openai library` can accelerate development, reduce potential errors, and allow for a more straightforward integration, especially for those new to API interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will make use of the `OpenAI API` through a library called `LangChain`. `LangChain` is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using LLMs. As a language model integration framework, `LangChain's` use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis. `LangChain` allows you to quickly change between different underlying LLMs with minimal code changes.\n"

This approach allows for reusability, personalization, and automation, ensuring that the output is tailored to specific needs without rewriting the entire prompt.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### **Key Characteristics of a Dynamic Prompt**\n",
        "1. **Variables**:\n",
        "   - Dynamic prompts include placeholders for variables, like `{name}`, `{style}`, or `{text}`, which can be filled with different values at runtime.\n",
        "   - For example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",

        "     ```\n",

        "2. **Context-Aware**:\n",
        "   - They adapt to the context, such as the user’s preferences, conversation history, or specific tasks.\n",
        "   - For instance, a dynamic prompt for summarization might consider the length of the desired output: \"Summarize the following article in less than {words} words.\"\n",
        "3. **Reusable Templates**:\n",
        "   - Instead of hardcoding individual tasks, dynamic prompts use templates that can be applied across multiple scenarios by simply replacing values.\n",
        "   - Example template:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     template_text = \"\"\"Write a {tone} response to the following message:\n",
        "     message: {user_message}\"\"\"\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "4. **Personalization**:\n",
        "   - Dynamic prompts can be personalized based on user inputs or profiles, enhancing user experience. For example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     f\"Hi {name}, here’s the weather forecast for {city}!\"\n",

Short-term memory is what a human has only recently discovered in the last minute or so. For humans, learning is converting short-term memory into long-term memory that we will retain.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process works somewhat differently for a LLM. Long-term memory was the weight of the neural network when it was initially trained or finetuned. Short-term memory is additional information that we wish the LLM to retain from previous prompts. For example, if the first prompt is \"My name is David\", the LLM will likely tell you hello and repeat your name. However, the LLM will not know the answer if the second prompt is \"What is my name.\" without adding a memory component.\n",

It is important to note that these objects are not affecting the long-term memory of the LLM, and once you discard the memory object, the LLM will forget. Additionally, the memory object can only hold so much information; newer information may replace older information once it is filled.\n",
        "\n",
        "One important point to remember is that LLM's only have their input prompt. To provide such memory, these objects are appending anything we wish the LLM to remember to the input prompt. This section will see two ways to augment the prompt with previous information: a buffer and a summary. The buffer prepends a script of the last conversation up to this point. The summary approach keeps a consistently updated summary paragraph of the conversation."

Presper Eckert and John Mauchly built the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering between 1943 and 1946. A 1946 patent rights dispute with the university led Eckert and Mauchly to depart the Moore School to form the Electronic Control Company, later renamed Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation (EMCC), based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. That company first built a computer called BINAC (BINary Automatic Computer) for Northrop Aviation (which was little used, or perhaps not at all). Afterwards, the development of UNIVAC began in April 1946.[1] UNIVAC was first intended for the Bureau of the Census, which paid for much of the development, and then was put in production.\n",

Straus in a plane crash on October 25, 1949, EMCC was sold to typewriter, office machine, electric razor, and gun maker Remington Rand on February 15, 1950. Eckert and Mauchly now reported to Leslie Groves, the retired army general who had previously managed building The Pentagon and led the Manhattan Project.\n",

        "The most famous UNIVAC product was the UNIVAC I mainframe computer of 1951, which became known for predicting the outcome of the U.S. presidential election the following year: this incident is noteworthy because the computer correctly predicted an Eisenhower landslide over Adlai Stevenson, whereas the final Gallup poll had Eisenhower winning the popular vote 51–49 in a close contest.\n",
        "\n",
        "The prediction led CBS's news boss in New York, Siegfried Mickelson, to believe the computer was in error, and he refused to allow the prediction to be read. Instead, the crew showed some staged theatrics that suggested the computer was not responsive, and announced it was predicting 8–7 odds for an Eisenhower win (the actual prediction was 100–1 in his favour).\n",
        "\n",
        "When the predictions proved true—Eisenhower defeated Stevenson in a landslide, with UNIVAC coming within 3.5% of his popular vote total and four votes of his Electoral College total—Charles Collingwood, the on-air announcer, announced that they had failed to believe the earlier prediction.\n",

        "The United States Army requested a UNIVAC computer from Congress in 1951. Colonel Wade Heavey explained to the Senate subcommittee that the national mobilization planning involved multiple industries and agencies: \"This is a tremendous calculating process...there are equations that can not be solved by hand or by electrically operated computing machines because they involve millions of relationships that would take a lifetime to figure out.\" Heavey told the subcommittee it was needed to help with mobilization and other issues similar to the invasion of Normandy that were based on the relationships of various groups.\n",

Remington Rand also had an engineering research lab in Norwalk, Connecticut, and later bought Engineering Research Associates (ERA) in St. Paul, Minnesota. In 1953 or 1954 Remington Rand merged their Norwalk tabulating machine division, the ERA \"scientific\" computer division, and the UNIVAC \"business\" computer division into a single division under the UNIVAC name. This severely annoyed those who had been with ERA and with the Norwalk laboratory.\n",
