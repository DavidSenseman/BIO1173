    "\n",
    "In machine learning the term, \"fit the model\", means to **_train_** the model using the numerical values in our dataset. During training, the model **_learns_** from the data. In essence, the model makes a prediction of what it \"thinks\" is the correct answer, and then adjusts its trainable parameters (weights and biases) in an effort to make its predictions more accurate (i.e. minimize the loss function).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **fit step** involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Forward passes (feeding input data through the network).\n",
    "* Backward passes (calculating derivatives using backpropagation).\n",
    "* Updating weights based on gradients to improve predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fit step is by far the most _computationally_ demanding step. This is where GPU's and TPU's are used to speed up the training. With relatively small neural networks like this one, a relatively modern laptop will come with a **_central processing unit (CPU)_** that can handled all the computations involved in a training a small neural network in a reasonable time period. Increasing, newer laptops are being equipped with \"AI chips\" that can speed of training by a significant amout. \n",

    "* the $Y$-values\n",
    "* the level of _verbosity_ (how much feedback should be printed out during training)\n",
    "* the number of `epochs`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the number of epoch is set to `100`. An epoch means training the neural network with all the training data for one complete cycle. During an epoch, all of the data is used exactly once. A forward pass and a backward pass together are counted as one pass. \n",

The first layer is the input layer because it contains the **input_dim** parameter that the programmer sets to be the number of inputs the dataset has. The network needs one input neuron for every column in the data set (including dummy variables).  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also several hidden layers, with 25 and 10 neurons each. You might be wondering how the programmer chose these numbers. Selecting a hidden neuron structure is one of the most common questions about neural networks. Unfortunately, there is no right answer. These are hyperparameters. They are settings that can affect neural network performance, yet there are no clearly defined means of setting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, more hidden neurons mean more capability to fit complex problems. However, too many neurons can lead to overfitting and lengthy training times. Too few can lead to underfitting the problem and will sacrifice accuracy. Also, how many layers you have is another hyperparameter. In general, more layers allow the neural network to perform more of its feature engineering and data preprocessing. But this also comes at the expense of training times and the risk of overfitting. In general, you will see that neuron counts start larger near the input layer and tend to shrink towards the output layer in a triangular fashion. \n",

    "Some techniques use machine learning to optimize these values. These will be discussed later in this course.\n",

However, comparisons across different types of data would be invalid because the magnitude of the RSME is dependent on the scale of the numbers used. In other words, you will get a larger RSME when trying to predict a bigger number than a smaller one."
